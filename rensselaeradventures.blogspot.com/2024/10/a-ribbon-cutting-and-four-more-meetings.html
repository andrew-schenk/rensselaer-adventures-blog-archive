<p><b>Ribbon Cutting for the Brick Streets</b></p><p>On Thursday morning a ribbon cutting was held for the Brick Streets Project.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="b-hbp-video b-uploaded" frameborder="0" height="491" id="BLOGGER-video-4bd515bcfa7e3beb-14330" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" src="../../../www.blogger.com/video3ed4.html?token=AD6v5dzIwFqdVma9atiIXQnzNzICmVz-mdTQm-aGHyoaCTFbUyggHxly5-RIzVDqgFcvGaHmVLtttNbeRMdzuSwpSoGAzYR_lLbqPOR3kkVzRd3CWiKQp9SHtuZxuTxKb8rBRiAOBLVa" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="590"></iframe></div>Before the scissors came out, there were several speakers who thanked the many people who contributed to this project, which was years in the making. Among speakers was Mayor Phillips, former Mayor Wood, Congressman Baird, a representative for Senator Braun, State Senator Niemeyer, State Represenative Kendall Culp, and representatives from Kimley Horn, KIRPC, and EDA.<div><br /></div><div>There was a surprisingly large crowd.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5HJzpR5hyphenhyphenudAj0GSBHN_JRaAow7kOd/s1280/crowdIMG_1487.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5HJzpR5hyphenhyphenudAj0GSBHN_JRaAow7kOd/w640-h480/crowdIMG_1487.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>After the event, people could eat donuts. They left a lot, which were then served at the Customer Appreciation Lunch in City Hall from 11:00 until 1:00. The attendance there, at least when I went, was quite small.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhByRp5Elu6H4GiOPBiQVW915fsxRA0Gqn12KXULR-/s1280/donuts1484.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="771" data-original-width="1280" height="386" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhByRp5Elu6H4GiOPBiQVW915fsxRA0Gqn12KXULR-/w640-h386/donuts1484.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p><b>Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission met Monday evening. After approving minutes and five claims, it approved a declaratory resolution that does three things. It enlarges the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area, it establishes the Van Elementary Residential Allocation Area, and it amends and restates the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area. This is part of the process to create a residential TIF area to develop the area north of the Van Rensselaer School. It is also only a start to a process. The matter now goes to the Plan Commission, then the City Council, and finally back to the Redevelopment Commission.</p><p>JCEDO reported on the façade grant program. Top Link and Earth Magic have completed their work and have been reimbursed 50% of their costs. Shanley Construction has completed its work but has not yet submitted the required paperwork for reimbursement. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=934219152081242&amp;set=a.466096222226873" target="_blank">latest grant has been awarded</a> to the new owner of what is called the "Carriage House." (Old maps identify this as used for storage so I do not know the source of the Carriage-House name.)</p><p>Below you can see the two new porch columns of the Mr Shanley added to the <a href="../../2023/06/a-tour-of-mansion.html" target="_blank">Forsythe mansion.</a>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9FCMIjVFtWByaBXjHMcNmSQS66Ro3aZnvSMerFlw/s1280/FacadeForthsyeIMG_1205.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9FCMIjVFtWByaBXjHMcNmSQS66Ro3aZnvSMerFlw/w640-h480/FacadeForthsyeIMG_1205.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Park Board also met on Monday evening and the meeting has so many people attending it was moved from the conference room at City Hall to the Council Chambers. This was the first meeting at which Heather Hall was present from the beginning as Park Superintendent.</p><p>Several guests were recognized and talked about their concerns. Soccer is still concerned about the grass where the old Monnett school was located. 230 kids signed up for the Fall program. Greg Whaley gave an update on the Miniature Train Proposal. A recent Redevelopment Commission meeting provided some money to have some architectural plans prepared, and these were distributed and discussed. No action was taken.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8Dm/s1280/Plans.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1271" data-original-width="1280" height="636" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8Dm/w640-h636/Plans.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>Mrs Hall asked if there were bylaws for either the Park Board or the Rensselaer Community Recreational Development Corporation. (Park Board meeting include both groups that have somewhat different members.) There will be a search for them.</p><p>Filson Park is at substantial completion. Left to finish are the street lights, concrete caps on the fountain and behind the stage, benches, and an arch over the entryway. Next week the Prairie Arts Council will install an art work and the bird that sits by eMbers will also be added. Rental prices for the shelter and the park have not yet been determined. There will be a ribbon cutting and various activities on October 24 from 4:00 until 7:30 on October 24.</p><p>Project underway or soon to be underway include some facilities upgrades. LaRue Pool may get a facelift and perhaps a slide. Mrs Hall would like to have the mural wrap around the whole building. A pickle ball league has been established. The old tennis courts at Brookside will be moved a bit to the east and converted to four pickle ball courts. This project has received a substantial donation from a Jackson family. The Board approved moving forward with this project and now it is in the lap of the City.&nbsp; It may take some time to figure out the best uses for the old power plant.&nbsp;</p><p>The softball tournament scheduled for this weekend at the Blacker Fields has been canceled. Not enough teams signed up.</p><p><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Jasper County Tourism Commission met on Tuesday morning. It heard a presentation from a person from <a href="https://www.travelindiana.com/" target="_blank">Travel Indiana</a>, which publishes a quarterly tourism magazine. It prints 30,000 copies that are distributed across Indiana and also has a web site promoting tourism. The Commission is considering advertising in the magazine but no decision has been reached yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://thecarnegieplayers.org/" target="_blank">Carnegie Players</a> had a request for $25,000 to help renovate its building at 220 N Franklin Street. The building needs a new roof, new windows, and a ramp to make it handicapped accessible. At present the Carnegie Players do not have permanent home and whatever venue is available. One of their problems is rehearsal space. The best space in Rensselaer is the auditorium at the High School, but t is used by the high school for three plays a year, the new middle school theater group for one, and Fendig Theater in the summer. Rehearsal before a production can take two months, so there is not a lot of time left to share at the high school. The Carnegie Players' building can have at least two rehearsal sites and the Players are willing to share them with others in the community. It also wants to coordinate with other arts groups in scheduling so their events do not complete. A donor is matching donations for the roof. The Commission approved the entire ask of $25,000.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXXSPcmQ9r_pljtq-TXLy2Oqcb-bdqtWLR1yWBy3T/s1280/TheaterBuilding1203.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="605" data-original-width="1280" height="302" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXXSPcmQ9r_pljtq-TXLy2Oqcb-bdqtWLR1yWBy3T/w640-h302/TheaterBuilding1203.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Fountain Park Chautauqua asked for $5000 to bring <a href="https://www.purduealumnus.org/the-piano-man/alumni/" target="_blank">Bruce Barker The Piano Man</a> to the Chautauqua. They did not have a representative to present the case and answer questions. One Commission member suggested that the admission price of $5 was too low. The Commission approved $1500.</p><p><b>Airport Authority Board meeting</b></p><p>The Airport Authority Board met Tuesday evening. They discussed a planned land swap that has a verbal agreement but the details need to be finalized. They also discussed plans for a new nine-unit hangar that will probably be built in 2025. They have been accumulating the funds for this for four years and it the hangar is not built soon some of those funds will go away. A lot of what the Airport does is determined by the rules and regulations of various Federal and State bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>The old hangar building along the taxiway needs to come down but there are no plans yet of when and what will be done on that site.

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
