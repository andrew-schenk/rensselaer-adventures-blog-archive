At the school program each kid told a bit about the saint he or she was representing.</div><p><b>Commissioners meeting</b></p><p>The Commissioners met Monday for a rather uneventful monthly meeting. There were no buried cable requests. However there was mention of a problem with contractors installing cable along State highways. When contractors get permits to install in the County right-of-way along County roads, the County Highway Department gives those applications to the Surveyor to see if there are any drains involved. When contractors get permits to install along State roads, those permits are not forwarded to the Surveyor. Recently about seven miles of cable were installed along US 231 and the cables were installed above tiles rather than below them.</p><p>Mayor Phillips addressed the Commissioners informing them of the upcoming project to upgrade the sewer system as required by a court order several years ago. To pay for this project, the City will probably be raising sewer rates over the next three years by 40%, 40%, and 20%. This will about double the sewer bill of the average resident, which is $55.00. It will also have a big impact on the County and for this reason that the Mayor was telling the Commissioners about what to expect.</p><p>The Commissioners approved a service agreement for some tax software from a company called GUTS. The Health Department received approval for a new hire of a multi-media communications coordinator. The primary reason for the position is that the Health Department has seen an influx of Hispanics who do not speak English and wants someone who can communicate with them. The Health Department assured the Commissioners that the person would be available to help other departments who might need translations. The Council must approve the funding for this position. Remodeling of the Health Department is going well.</p><p>The County''s IT guy noted that the County was left without internet for a day because a fiber-optic cable was cut. He asked that the Commissioners approve a second, backup internet provider so if the main provider's service failed, service would not be interrupted. The cost would be $119.95 per month for three years. The Commissioners approved his request.</p><p>The Commissioners approved a Carpenter Wind Farm/Drain Tile memorandum of understanding. This had been requested by the Drainage Board and worked out with input from the County's compliance monitor. The reason that Commissioners were asked for their approval is because they hired the compliance monitor.&nbsp;</p><p>The Commissoners approved two rezones that had been sent to them from the Plan Commission with a favorable recommendation. The first was an amendment to the zoning map adding four parcels to the wind-farm overlay district in Carpenter Township and the second was for a zoning change from A1 to R1 for a possible subdivision in Walker Township.</p><p>The building that the Jasper County EMS is using in Remington is owned by Remington and Carpenter Township. They want the County to assume ownership with the provision that if the County does not use it for six months, the ownership reverts back to Remington/Carpenter Township. The Commissioners approved the transfer.</p><p>In other business, the Highway Department wants a "yield" sign switched to a "stop" sign in a northern subdivision that has expanded, It will need a public hearing. The Commissioners agreed to a proposal of $20,000 to repair and polish the tiles on the first floor of the Court House. (The second floor was done a year or two ago.) The State Board of Accounts was unhappy that the salary contracts for the Sheriff had not been signed so the Sheriff asked the Commissioners to sign them. He also said that the State Board of Accounts wants a better accounting for inventory. Given the rain on Monday, the Commissioners will let the burn ban expire on Tuesday. The meeting was continued until Nov 18 if needed.</p><p><b>Drainage Board meeting</b></p><p>After a short break, the Drainage Board met on Monday morning. First Church is expanding its parking lot but said that they had planned the existing retention plan to be big enough to handle the expansion. The Board approved. The Board then approved the Carpenter Wind Farm MOU that the Commissioners had approved earlier in the morning. A drainage plan for a proposed community center at Grace Fellowship was approved.</p><p>A drainage for a substation that is part of the Biscayne Falls solar project in Walker Township was approved conditional on its getting its State permits. (Biscayne Falls is the new name of what was the Solar Pack solar farm.) Three bids were opened for the Kankakee River phase 5 bank stabilization project. Phase 5 covers the last two miles of the project. There were three bids, but one was incomplete. The bid was awarded to the low bid, Gutwein from Francesville. It covers excavation only. Bids were then opened for the materials. There were three companies bidding and all bids were accepted so that the project will be able to get material when they are needed.</p><p>There was a brief discussion of the possibility of a boat launch on a bit of County land along the Kankakee. That lot is considered too small but perhaps some additional land could be purchased. Porter and Lake County tourism are interested in getting better access to the river for recreation and may be adding public-access sites on their side of the River.</p><p>The meeting adjourned at 10:50.</p><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The first item of business at the Rensselaer Park Board meeting Monday evening was a request from the Little Cousin Jasper Festival to continue use of Potawatomi Park for future festivals. The Festival Committee thinks the Park venue works better than the Courthouse Square. There was some discussion of what changes could be made to make Potawatomi Park work even better in the future, and having electricity in the center was one item mentioned. There may also be some changes downtown that may make it easier to serve beer at events. The Board approved the request to use Potawatomi and nearby parks in 2025.</p><p>There followed a discussion of plans for a miniature train display in Foundation Park. Preliminary plans had been presented at the <a href="../../2024/10/a-ribbon-cutting-and-four-more-meetings.html" target="_blank">previous meeting</a> and Board members suggested three changes: eliminating the small parking lot off the highway, bringing the display closer to the highway, and shortening it by having only two cars instead of three. There were concerns about the cost of maintenance. The item was tabled for the next meeting.</p><p>There were some updates discussed. The Jackson Pickle-ball Courts have been paved. The asphalt will need 30 days to cure. It will have four courts running east and west. During the winter it will probably be fenced and it should be ready for use in the Spring.</p><p>The Board approved funding for a mural on the south side of the Brookside Pool building. That side was recently power-washed and primed. The Board also approved investigating how best to illuminate the mural at night.</p><div>Below is the LaRue Pool bath house with its new coat of primer paint.</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOBN5q4YLmNgy7Bc0kK7V9BZ_UG3rot3MhyAy-d25/s1280/poolhouse1752.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="857" data-original-width="1280" height="428" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOBN5q4YLmNgy7Bc0kK7V9BZ_UG3rot3MhyAy-d25/w640-h428/poolhouse1752.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div><p>Park restrooms except those at Filson Park have been winterized so are no longer available. The Park takes care of 167 trees that the Urban Forest Ministry has planted and waters them for three years. The Soccer league is thinking about a policy for unruly spectators, which was a problem this year. New roofs are needed for the LaRue Pool bath house and the Gifford Shelter. There is the possibility that next year some of the Park baseball teams might play teams from neighboring towns. The comment was made that no one can pitch; in some games most runs are scored by walks.</p><p>The next meeting will be on December 2 if there seems to be a need for a December meeting.</p></div><div>I noticed the other day that some kids were playing in our new splash pad.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGthnf4qai4FBtRK05aaN-abtp27E3tqLxbDh6y9C/s1237/splash1754.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="664" data-original-width="1237" height="344" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGthnf4qai4FBtRK05aaN-abtp27E3tqLxbDh6y9C/w640-h344/splash1754.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /></div></div><div><b>Alpenhorns at the Library</b></div><div><p>The alpenhorns <a href="../../2019/11/mostly-commissioners-meeting.html" target="_blank">returned</a> to the Rensselaer Library on Sunday.

The conference has a very large range of school sizes.</p><p><b>&nbsp;Rensselaer Plan Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Advisory Plan Commission met Thursday afternoon. Under old business it discussed what the Commission wanted before it approves&nbsp;<a href="../../2024/07/murals-subdivision-and-more-meetings.html" target="_blank">the plat for the St. Joseph's Building &amp; Trades subdivision</a>. They decided that if the City completes the sidewalk along Sparling (which currently stops at the Fr. Banet substation), the subdivision also needs to have a sidewalk along Sparling. Curbs and gutters will not be needed, but street signs and street lights will be. The item was continued to the next meeting.</p><p>The Commission approved a five-acre split from a larger parcel north of Donaldsons. The approval was needed for a building permit to be issued.</p><p>Earlier in October the <a href="../../2024/10/a-ribbon-cutting-and-four-more-meetings.html" target="_blank">Redevelopment Commission passed a plan</a> for the Rensselaer Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development area that adds to the area in which TIF funds can be spent and also establishes a small residential TIF area. It was approved and will now move to the City Council.</p><p><b>Jasper County Plan Commission meeting</b></p><p>I decided to attend the JC Plan Commission via Zoom on Monday evening. It was a frustrating experience at the start because all I had was a dark screen with the names of the other people who were using Zoom. It turned out that the meeting did not have a quorum when it was supposed to start. After about twenty minutes enough members were found and the meeting started. Then I had audio and no video. Video came on twice during the meeting for a few minutes each time, but the camera was not aimed at the front of the room. I believe Vince Urbano presided based on the voice.</p><p>There were three causes on the agenda. The first was a rezone from A1 to R1 in Walker Township. The parcel is 8+ acres and the petitioner wants to sell off part of the parcel for housing and develop three smaller lots. He said the land was not used for agriculture. The request was approved and will now go to the Commissioners for final approval.</p><p>The second cause was a request to add four parcels to the existing Wind Farm Overlay District in Carpenter and Jordan Townships. That overlay district had been approved in May but there was some additional land needed for underground wiring and a turn lane. There was one comment from the audience, a neighbor wondering how the change affected him. I could not hear some of the response but it seemed he was not affected. The request was approved and will be on the agenda of the November Commissioners meeting.</p><p>The final item was an amendment to the UPO. The members received a handout with the proposed changes that eliminate some things not used and clean up language. No action was taken at this meeting. The members were encouraged to review the changes and the changes will be considered at a future meeting. The meeting adjourned a few minutes before 8:00.</p><p><b>Continued Commissioners meeting</b></p><p>The continued Commissioners meeting on Tuesday dealt with routine matters. The Commissioners formally approved memoranda of understanding with the Soil &amp; Water District for funding a position. There were two memoranda, one for this year and one for next. They heard an update on the medical plan renewal, which they approved. Total costs will go down by 0.86% and the dental benefit will increase from $1000 to $1500. They formally approved the new canteen service agreement with the Sheriff's Department. The cost of meals will increase by 10&#162; per meal. The average number of inmates at the jail has been 88, though on Tuesday it was only 76. The Commissioners extended the burn ban for another seven days.</p><p>They approved financial commitment letters for the Highway Department seeking grants for safety funding. The commitment is that the County will provide a match if the grant is awarded. The proposal is for pavement marking and a sign inventory. The head of JCEDO requested that she be approved for a license on the Beacon mapping system that would allow her to see what County licensees see. She said the information would be useful in promoting economic development and the request was approved. The Commissioners approved a repair bill for Community Services.&nbsp;</p><p>The Surveyor noted that Comcast has been boring without getting approval for boring under County drains. He told them to stop. He also noted that a drainage plan that had been approved in 2012 at the Roselawn exit had never been finished and the business involved now wants to add a Burger King to its site.&nbsp;</p><p>The Coroner is working with Hamstra to design a new forensic center. He talked about an incident without really explaining what it was. Apparently there were privacy issues. He noted that there have been three traumatic cases recently.</p><p>The meeting lasted about 45 minutes.</p><p><b>More Scarecrow Trail Pictures</b></p><p>I have shown some of the scarecrows in Milroy Park in the past few posts.

A lot needed more practice.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Board of Public Works meeting</b></p><p>In its meeting on Monday afternoon, the Rensselaer Board of Public Works &amp; Safety approved two applicants for the Fire Department. It then approved paying four invoices, two from Commonwealth Engineering for $9,607 and $12,331, and two from Maguire Iron for $162,685 and $$20,550. Work on the Drexel water tower is not finished. The work that is being done is inside the tank.</p><p>The Board then approved moving forward with an engineering agreement with Commonwealth for the long-term sewage control plan. This plan will have three sections, the waste-water treatment plant, an interceptor line, and relining the Melville sewer. The goal is to have it finished to have bids by April and close with the State Revolving Fund (SRF) by June. I did not catch the amount of the agreement.</p><p>Finally, the Board approved using funds left over from the water project to replace the water main along McKinley from Angelica to Vine and to also replace some lead service lines. The section of the water main along McKinley is a problem section that has had several leaks. The use of funds also needs SRF approval.</p><p><b>Rensselaer City Council meeting</b></p><p>Half an hour after the start of the BPW meeting started, the Rensselaer City Council met. After the usual preliminaries, the Major asked for citizens' comments and got one. A woman wants an ordinance that closes to vehicles undeveloped alleys, where the City owns the land but there is no roadway. Her concern comes from a neighbor who insists he has a right to drive down the undefined alley and may be driving on her property. The City will investigate her problem.</p><p>Next the Council had a public hearing on the proposed closing of the Scott Street rail crossing. Only one citizen spoke, asking why the City wanted to close the crossing. The City will receive about $80,000 from CSX for closing the crossing and would like to use the funds to pave the area around the depot and fix the drainage in that area. The Scott Street crossing does not have a stop light, unlike other crossings. Once closed, the City will not be able to reopen it. The vote on this matter will be taken at the next Council meeting.</p><p>Community Services, which operates the only public transportation service in Jasper County, would like the City to provide $12,000 as it did last year to support its transportation services. 95% of the trips it makes are in Rensselaer and it charges only $1 for a trip. It has 9 vehicles and will be getting a new one at the beginning of the year funded by a grant but must provide a cash match. The Council took no action at this meeting.</p><p>The Street Department had sought bids to remove 29 trees, 26 in City right-of-ways and three in the Cemetery. The low bid was from Timber Tree Service for $22,715 and the Council approved accepting the bid.</p><p>The Chief of Police would like a revision to the golf-cart ordinance so that only golf carts will be registered and not UTVs (utility task vehicles). He would like the ordinance to grandfather in UTVs that have already been registered but not allow any new ones. No action was taken at this meeting because the item was meant only for discussion.</p><p>The Council received an AMI metering update. AMI stands for Advanced metering&nbsp; infrastructure and the meters are smart meters, able to communicate with the utility, allowing the supplier to catch problems quickly. Most or most of the electrical and water customers have AMI metering, but there are no plans at present to do gas. Installation of AMI meters is ahead of schedule.</p><p>The Council approved Grimmer pay request #7 of $211,504.50 for work on the Brick Streets project. The project is finishing up with items from a punch list being addressed. The Council passed the 2025 budget. It transferred $74,000 from this year's budget to the rainy-day fund. It did not pass the 2025 salary ordinance because there were still some changes to be made for on-call work. The gas tracker for October is a 1.5&#162; decrease per hundred cubic feet.</p><p>The Council approved spending $250 for a ribbon cutting event at Filson Park on October 24. There will be pumpkin carving and other events including a free movie after. There will be a second ribbon cutting on the 24th, this one at about 7:00 at the fire station for the new training tower.</p><p>Mr Watson commented that a truck being used by the water department was embarrassing and told them to seek bids for a new truck. New police cars have been delivered and are being made ready for service. About 400 people attended the open house at the fire station last week. The burn ban has been extended for another seven days. The electric department sent people to the area hit by Helene to help restore power. The leaf vac is ready to start picking up leaves. Letters to homeowners with lead service lines will be sent in the next few weeks. The Council approved the Cemetery purchasing two mowers from next year's budget.</p><p><b>Jasper County Council meeting</b></p><p>&#8232;At Tuesday's meeting the Jasper County Council approved its 2025 meeting schedule with meetings at 6:00 on the third Tuesday of each month. It then moved up approving the budget of the Rensselaer Central School Corporation so the representatives could attend the School Board meeting that also meets on third Tuesday evenings. The current enrollment in the Corporation is 1438. The Corporation recently closed on a bond with a lower-than-expected interest rate of just under 3%.</p><p>&#8232;Returning to order on the agenda, the Council approved a memorandum of understanding with the Jasper County Soil &amp; Water Conservation District about the splitting the salary of an employee of the District. It then heard from the Prosecutor, Jacob Taulman, about the salary of the 4th deputy. The person in that position is leaving for a much higher salary. The salary is listed at $57K in the salary ordinance, which is considerably less than the salaries that will be paid to part-time public defenders and may not be enough to attract qualified applicants. After discussion of what the salary should be, the Council passed a motion to allow up to $96k. That will be put in the Salary Ordinance in December and an additional appropriation will have to be made next year.</p><p>&#8232;The Council held two public hearings. The first was to modify the local option income tax rate. The Council wanted to increase the amount going to Emergency Medical Services and reduce the amount going to the stabilization fund. (The Stabilization Fund is money the State withholds from the County so that if there is a year with unusually low tax receipts, the County budget will not have to drastically shrink.) In the discussion, a citizen pointed out that the numbers that the President of the Council read were not the same as those published in the newspaper. The changes passed with the note that the advertised numbers were incorrect.</p><p>&#8232;The second public hearing was to modify the property tax credit rate allocations between the three property tax classifications. I did not understand this item or the discussion. The three classifications are 1) homesteads; 2) residential, agricultural, long-term care, and other tangible property; and 3) nonresidential real property, personal property and other tangible property. The first two had their credit slightly increased and the third slightly decreased.</p><p>The Sheriff came to the meeting late because he did not realize that the Council had changed its start time to 6:00 from 7:00. He noted that the price of meal service is increasing. He said that his department has had eight deer-car accidents and as a result of this and some other factors, he will need more in his auto budget to finish the year. It will be on the agenda for the November meeting. He reported that the Department's retirement fund has had very good returns for the past two years and is now 81-82% fully funded.</p><p>The Council then approved its budget and also the budgets of the Airport Authority, the Northwest Solid Waste district, and the Iroquois Conservancy.</p><p>Karen Wilson from Emergency Management reported that she has been working with others collecting supplies for the area hit by Hurricane Helene and they have filled one truck trailer and part of a second. She also said that her office had received a grant of $150K to purchase radios for local first responders.</p><p>The next meeting will be on November 19th with a joint Commissioners/Council meeting preceding it at 5:00.</p><p>Odds &amp; ends</p><p>Here is a <a href="https://vimeo.com/1019921854?share=copy" target="_blank">link to a video</a>, most shot by drones, showing the construction of the new water tower.</p><p>Over the weekend this is what the house being built by the Building Trades program at SJC looked like.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjH1qwvOgFiHeA4LcXvng8dSK9XHyCObyiKAI5wkZC/s1280/buildingtradesIMG_1242.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjH1qwvOgFiHeA4LcXvng8dSK9XHyCObyiKAI5wkZC/w640-h480/buildingtradesIMG_1242.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The Fire Department has a scarecrow in Milroy Park.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNn-XlZ20Tjf5nr3r4BIFLYp0RLJdOw180omuW4M4/s1280/scareFireDeptIMG_1524.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="960" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNn-XlZ20Tjf5nr3r4BIFLYp0RLJdOw180omuW4M4/w480-h640/scareFireDeptIMG_1524.jpg" width="480" /></a></div>I had a picture of the gas department scarecrow in an earlier post, but the light was much better for this picture.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2Cbn-VrtMtziA2vA0r5A_xjAwoRfhcT22boVhQjk/s1280/scaregasIMG_1213.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2Cbn-VrtMtziA2vA0r5A_xjAwoRfhcT22boVhQjk/w640-h480/scaregasIMG_1213.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>I had a picture of the Chief Industries scarecrow earlier, but in that picture it did not have a head.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzO4EjCgY1BfOSedqYbZmQZnr-MNjnHU2NdE3EyDM/s1280/scareChiefIMG_1176.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzO4EjCgY1BfOSedqYbZmQZnr-MNjnHU2NdE3EyDM/w640-h480/scareChiefIMG_1176.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div>There is a comet in the western sky just after sunset.

<p><b>Ribbon Cutting for the Brick Streets</b></p><p>On Thursday morning a ribbon cutting was held for the Brick Streets Project.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="b-hbp-video b-uploaded" frameborder="0" height="491" id="BLOGGER-video-4bd515bcfa7e3beb-12978" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" src="../../../www.blogger.com/video23f8.html?token=AD6v5dwm45oVIz9YqVi7057is1eLtACK-J7ZF72brP0z39mEHDiCag5-ZsBKA5rNv65jbuTpq6PgpKfNQU7HeX2ts6BUJh8wxIU8ov_xho_WShI9A7rjgWNcc_NhbYRFYWWpt6aHH8oF" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="590"></iframe></div>Before the scissors came out, there were several speakers who thanked the many people who contributed to this project, which was years in the making. Among speakers was Mayor Phillips, former Mayor Wood, Congressman Baird, a representative for Senator Braun, State Senator Niemeyer, State Represenative Kendall Culp, and representatives from Kimley Horn, KIRPC, and EDA.<div><br /></div><div>There was a surprisingly large crowd.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5HJzpR5hyphenhyphenudAj0GSBHN_JRaAow7kOd/s1280/crowdIMG_1487.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5HJzpR5hyphenhyphenudAj0GSBHN_JRaAow7kOd/w640-h480/crowdIMG_1487.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>After the event, people could eat donuts. They left a lot, which were then served at the Customer Appreciation Lunch in City Hall from 11:00 until 1:00. The attendance there, at least when I went, was quite small.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhByRp5Elu6H4GiOPBiQVW915fsxRA0Gqn12KXULR-/s1280/donuts1484.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="771" data-original-width="1280" height="386" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhByRp5Elu6H4GiOPBiQVW915fsxRA0Gqn12KXULR-/w640-h386/donuts1484.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p><b>Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission met Monday evening. After approving minutes and five claims, it approved a declaratory resolution that does three things. It enlarges the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area, it establishes the Van Elementary Residential Allocation Area, and it amends and restates the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area. This is part of the process to create a residential TIF area to develop the area north of the Van Rensselaer School. It is also only a start to a process. The matter now goes to the Plan Commission, then the City Council, and finally back to the Redevelopment Commission.</p><p>JCEDO reported on the façade grant program. Top Link and Earth Magic have completed their work and have been reimbursed 50% of their costs. Shanley Construction has completed its work but has not yet submitted the required paperwork for reimbursement. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=934219152081242&amp;set=a.466096222226873" target="_blank">latest grant has been awarded</a> to the new owner of what is called the "Carriage House." (Old maps identify this as used for storage so I do not know the source of the Carriage-House name.)</p><p>Below you can see the two new porch columns of the Mr Shanley added to the <a href="../../2023/06/a-tour-of-mansion.html" target="_blank">Forsythe mansion.</a>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9FCMIjVFtWByaBXjHMcNmSQS66Ro3aZnvSMerFlw/s1280/FacadeForthsyeIMG_1205.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9FCMIjVFtWByaBXjHMcNmSQS66Ro3aZnvSMerFlw/w640-h480/FacadeForthsyeIMG_1205.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Park Board also met on Monday evening and the meeting has so many people attending it was moved from the conference room at City Hall to the Council Chambers. This was the first meeting at which Heather Hall was present from the beginning as Park Superintendent.</p><p>Several guests were recognized and talked about their concerns. Soccer is still concerned about the grass where the old Monnett school was located. 230 kids signed up for the Fall program. Greg Whaley gave an update on the Miniature Train Proposal. A recent Redevelopment Commission meeting provided some money to have some architectural plans prepared, and these were distributed and discussed. No action was taken.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8Dm/s1280/Plans.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1271" data-original-width="1280" height="636" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8Dm/w640-h636/Plans.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>Mrs Hall asked if there were bylaws for either the Park Board or the Rensselaer Community Recreational Development Corporation. (Park Board meeting include both groups that have somewhat different members.) There will be a search for them.</p><p>Filson Park is at substantial completion. Left to finish are the street lights, concrete caps on the fountain and behind the stage, benches, and an arch over the entryway. Next week the Prairie Arts Council will install an art work and the bird that sits by eMbers will also be added. Rental prices for the shelter and the park have not yet been determined. There will be a ribbon cutting and various activities on October 24 from 4:00 until 7:30 on October 24.</p><p>Project underway or soon to be underway include some facilities upgrades. LaRue Pool may get a facelift and perhaps a slide. Mrs Hall would like to have the mural wrap around the whole building. A pickle ball league has been established. The old tennis courts at Brookside will be moved a bit to the east and converted to four pickle ball courts. This project has received a substantial donation from a Jackson family. The Board approved moving forward with this project and now it is in the lap of the City.&nbsp; It may take some time to figure out the best uses for the old power plant.&nbsp;</p><p>The softball tournament scheduled for this weekend at the Blacker Fields has been canceled. Not enough teams signed up.</p><p><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Jasper County Tourism Commission met on Tuesday morning. It heard a presentation from a person from <a href="https://www.travelindiana.com/" target="_blank">Travel Indiana</a>, which publishes a quarterly tourism magazine. It prints 30,000 copies that are distributed across Indiana and also has a web site promoting tourism. The Commission is considering advertising in the magazine but no decision has been reached yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://thecarnegieplayers.org/" target="_blank">Carnegie Players</a> had a request for $25,000 to help renovate its building at 220 N Franklin Street. The building needs a new roof, new windows, and a ramp to make it handicapped accessible. At present the Carnegie Players do not have permanent home and whatever venue is available. One of their problems is rehearsal space. The best space in Rensselaer is the auditorium at the High School, but t is used by the high school for three plays a year, the new middle school theater group for one, and Fendig Theater in the summer. Rehearsal before a production can take two months, so there is not a lot of time left to share at the high school. The Carnegie Players' building can have at least two rehearsal sites and the Players are willing to share them with others in the community. It also wants to coordinate with other arts groups in scheduling so their events do not complete. A donor is matching donations for the roof. The Commission approved the entire ask of $25,000.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXXSPcmQ9r_pljtq-TXLy2Oqcb-bdqtWLR1yWBy3T/s1280/TheaterBuilding1203.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="605" data-original-width="1280" height="302" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXXSPcmQ9r_pljtq-TXLy2Oqcb-bdqtWLR1yWBy3T/w640-h302/TheaterBuilding1203.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Fountain Park Chautauqua asked for $5000 to bring <a href="https://www.purduealumnus.org/the-piano-man/alumni/" target="_blank">Bruce Barker The Piano Man</a> to the Chautauqua. They did not have a representative to present the case and answer questions. One Commission member suggested that the admission price of $5 was too low. The Commission approved $1500.</p><p><b>Airport Authority Board meeting</b></p><p>The Airport Authority Board met Tuesday evening. They discussed a planned land swap that has a verbal agreement but the details need to be finalized. They also discussed plans for a new nine-unit hangar that will probably be built in 2025. They have been accumulating the funds for this for four years and it the hangar is not built soon some of those funds will go away. A lot of what the Airport does is determined by the rules and regulations of various Federal and State bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>The old hangar building along the taxiway needs to come down but there are no plans yet of when and what will be done on that site. Fuel sales were very strong in September. There was discussion of various maintenance issues and of things not working properly. The meeting lasted a bit less than an hour.</p><p><b>New art exhibit</b></p><p>There is new exhibit at the Fendig Gallery, the Jasper County Art League's Annual Member Show.

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
