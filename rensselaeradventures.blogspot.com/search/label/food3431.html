<p><b>Ribbon Cutting for the Brick Streets</b></p><p>On Thursday morning a ribbon cutting was held for the Brick Streets Project.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="b-hbp-video b-uploaded" frameborder="0" height="491" id="BLOGGER-video-4bd515bcfa7e3beb-3159" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" src="../../../draft.blogger.com/video79bf.html?token=AD6v5dwxDmf2LemgOtlkMvo1h3CI00hfChK6Sma-Zf_jB4Nef3Ijt-jA0l4sOLwlP_6VD8rjnnJUBl-ELDM-IZviB_U1QVPn0OSa4KHdhyix7Jxmh0hxVpVGmI2olFhmVQK5sMecG4E" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="590"></iframe></div>Before the scissors came out, there were several speakers who thanked the many people who contributed to this project, which was years in the making. Among speakers was Mayor Phillips, former Mayor Wood, Congressman Baird, a representative for Senator Braun, State Senator Niemeyer, State Represenative Kendall Culp, and representatives from Kimley Horn, KIRPC, and EDA.<div><br /></div><div>There was a surprisingly large crowd.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5HJzpR5hyphenhyphenudAj0GSBHN_JRaAow7kOd/s1280/crowdIMG_1487.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5HJzpR5hyphenhyphenudAj0GSBHN_JRaAow7kOd/w640-h480/crowdIMG_1487.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>After the event, people could eat donuts. They left a lot, which were then served at the Customer Appreciation Lunch in City Hall from 11:00 until 1:00. The attendance there, at least when I went, was quite small.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhByRp5Elu6H4GiOPBiQVW915fsxRA0Gqn12KXULR-/s1280/donuts1484.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="771" data-original-width="1280" height="386" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhByRp5Elu6H4GiOPBiQVW915fsxRA0Gqn12KXULR-/w640-h386/donuts1484.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p><b>Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission met Monday evening. After approving minutes and five claims, it approved a declaratory resolution that does three things. It enlarges the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area, it establishes the Van Elementary Residential Allocation Area, and it amends and restates the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area. This is part of the process to create a residential TIF area to develop the area north of the Van Rensselaer School. It is also only a start to a process. The matter now goes to the Plan Commission, then the City Council, and finally back to the Redevelopment Commission.</p><p>JCEDO reported on the façade grant program. Top Link and Earth Magic have completed their work and have been reimbursed 50% of their costs. Shanley Construction has completed its work but has not yet submitted the required paperwork for reimbursement. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=934219152081242&amp;set=a.466096222226873" target="_blank">latest grant has been awarded</a> to the new owner of what is called the "Carriage House." (Old maps identify this as used for storage so I do not know the source of the Carriage-House name.)</p><p>Below you can see the two new porch columns of the Mr Shanley added to the <a href="../../2023/06/a-tour-of-mansion.html" target="_blank">Forsythe mansion.</a>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9FCMIjVFtWByaBXjHMcNmSQS66Ro3aZnvSMerFlw/s1280/FacadeForthsyeIMG_1205.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9FCMIjVFtWByaBXjHMcNmSQS66Ro3aZnvSMerFlw/w640-h480/FacadeForthsyeIMG_1205.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Park Board also met on Monday evening and the meeting has so many people attending it was moved from the conference room at City Hall to the Council Chambers. This was the first meeting at which Heather Hall was present from the beginning as Park Superintendent.</p><p>Several guests were recognized and talked about their concerns. Soccer is still concerned about the grass where the old Monnett school was located. 230 kids signed up for the Fall program. Greg Whaley gave an update on the Miniature Train Proposal. A recent Redevelopment Commission meeting provided some money to have some architectural plans prepared, and these were distributed and discussed. No action was taken.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8Dm/s1280/Plans.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1271" data-original-width="1280" height="636" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8Dm/w640-h636/Plans.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>Mrs Hall asked if there were bylaws for either the Park Board or the Rensselaer Community Recreational Development Corporation. (Park Board meeting include both groups that have somewhat different members.) There will be a search for them.</p><p>Filson Park is at substantial completion. Left to finish are the street lights, concrete caps on the fountain and behind the stage, benches, and an arch over the entryway. Next week the Prairie Arts Council will install an art work and the bird that sits by eMbers will also be added. Rental prices for the shelter and the park have not yet been determined. There will be a ribbon cutting and various activities on October 24 from 4:00 until 7:30 on October 24.</p><p>Project underway or soon to be underway include some facilities upgrades. LaRue Pool may get a facelift and perhaps a slide. Mrs Hall would like to have the mural wrap around the whole building. A pickle ball league has been established. The old tennis courts at Brookside will be moved a bit to the east and converted to four pickle ball courts. This project has received a substantial donation from a Jackson family. The Board approved moving forward with this project and now it is in the lap of the City.&nbsp; It may take some time to figure out the best uses for the old power plant.&nbsp;</p><p>The softball tournament scheduled for this weekend at the Blacker Fields has been canceled. Not enough teams signed up.</p><p><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Jasper County Tourism Commission met on Tuesday morning. It heard a presentation from a person from <a href="https://www.travelindiana.com/" target="_blank">Travel Indiana</a>, which publishes a quarterly tourism magazine. It prints 30,000 copies that are distributed across Indiana and also has a web site promoting tourism. The Commission is considering advertising in the magazine but no decision has been reached yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://thecarnegieplayers.org/" target="_blank">Carnegie Players</a> had a request for $25,000 to help renovate its building at 220 N Franklin Street. The building needs a new roof, new windows, and a ramp to make it handicapped accessible. At present the Carnegie Players do not have permanent home and whatever venue is available. One of their problems is rehearsal space. The best space in Rensselaer is the auditorium at the High School, but t is used by the high school for three plays a year, the new middle school theater group for one, and Fendig Theater in the summer. Rehearsal before a production can take two months, so there is not a lot of time left to share at the high school. The Carnegie Players' building can have at least two rehearsal sites and the Players are willing to share them with others in the community. It also wants to coordinate with other arts groups in scheduling so their events do not complete. A donor is matching donations for the roof. The Commission approved the entire ask of $25,000.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXXSPcmQ9r_pljtq-TXLy2Oqcb-bdqtWLR1yWBy3T/s1280/TheaterBuilding1203.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="605" data-original-width="1280" height="302" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXXSPcmQ9r_pljtq-TXLy2Oqcb-bdqtWLR1yWBy3T/w640-h302/TheaterBuilding1203.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Fountain Park Chautauqua asked for $5000 to bring <a href="https://www.purduealumnus.org/the-piano-man/alumni/" target="_blank">Bruce Barker The Piano Man</a> to the Chautauqua. They did not have a representative to present the case and answer questions. One Commission member suggested that the admission price of $5 was too low. The Commission approved $1500.</p><p><b>Airport Authority Board meeting</b></p><p>The Airport Authority Board met Tuesday evening. They discussed a planned land swap that has a verbal agreement but the details need to be finalized. They also discussed plans for a new nine-unit hangar that will probably be built in 2025. They have been accumulating the funds for this for four years and it the hangar is not built soon some of those funds will go away. A lot of what the Airport does is determined by the rules and regulations of various Federal and State bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>The old hangar building along the taxiway needs to come down but there are no plans yet of when and what will be done on that site. Fuel sales were very strong in September. There was discussion of various maintenance issues and of things not working properly.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the administration of a grant of $157,945.77 that the Forestry Council had recently received.</p><p>The funding of the grant ultimately came from the Federal government. The Inflation Recovery Act allocated $1.5 billion to be used for trees, and Indiana's share of that&nbsp; was $4 million. The Indiana DNR awarded 16 grants. The Rensselaer grant was awarded to the Rensselaer Urban Forestry Council and it will be administered by the Jasper-Newton Foundation over the next three years. The grant will fund a database of trees on City property and right-of-ways, community outreach to encourage people to appreciate trees and plant them in their yards, and the planting of 50 trees on City right-of-ways. The grant proposal that was submitted requested support for 100 trees, but the DNR cut that to 50 so the other activities could be supported. Much of the hour-long discussion was about the details of grant administration.</p><p>Below the people attending the meeting pose in front of the tulip tree behind the Carnegie Center.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOotYLWsR1Hiu_oICg7wmeAnFoGyXZZKC48lB9_L0/s1280/trees1387.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1104" data-original-width="1280" height="552" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOotYLWsR1Hiu_oICg7wmeAnFoGyXZZKC48lB9_L0/w640-h552/trees1387.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission met on Monday evening to discuss a proposed residential housing development program. The plan includes a new TIF district that will have a small area from which taxes will be collected and a fairly large area on the east side of Rensselaer in which the revenues can be spent. The areas that will collect taxes from new development are two blocks north of Van Rensselaer School and a strip of land north of Elm Street and south of the Melt Blown company. Spending can be done for road improvements and sidewalks, utility improvements, parks, public safety, and education. No vote was taken. I believe the vote will be during the October 7 meeting. Then the matter will pass on to the City Council.</p></div><div><b>Odd &amp; ends</b></div><div><br /></div><div><div>From the legals in the September 26 issue of the <i>Rensselaer Republican:</i></div><div><blockquote>"Notice it is hereby given that the Remington Board of Zoning Appeals will conduct a public hearing&nbsp; at the Remington Townhall,,,on Tuesday, October 15, 2024 at 6:00 pm Eastern Standard Timeon Carpenter wind Farm LLC's application for a Special Exception permit to build 12 wind turbines within the town of Remington's extraterritorial jurisdiction."</blockquote></div><div>The notice goes on to note that this is part of a wind farm of 45 turbines, with the other 33 located in areas under the jurisdiction of the Jasper County Board of Zoning Appeal.

There was rain, but it was overnight on late Saturday and the fields were OK for Sunday. There were 30 teams participating.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_9_1Wi2VfuTJRlDO88S0ialQEUSa92sZyVn25xQ1/s1280/ball0497.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="927" data-original-width="1280" height="464" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_9_1Wi2VfuTJRlDO88S0ialQEUSa92sZyVn25xQ1/w640-h464/ball0497.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>New this year was an admission charge. Rensselaer had been the only venue used by the organizers of these tournaments that did not charge an admission fee.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhU-rVj8NJfv1c1V8hDwZPcS8S-dgXRO1Z-OiPf9Xc/s1280/Admission0499.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="1189" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhU-rVj8NJfv1c1V8hDwZPcS8S-dgXRO1Z-OiPf9Xc/w594-h640/Admission0499.jpg" width="594" /></a></div><p>There will be more tournaments for the next two or three weekends.</p><p>At the Park Board meeting on Monday evening, Mr Effinger explained that without the admission fee the teams had to pay a higher entrance fee, and that deterred some teams from coming to Rensselaer to play. There was concern that locals might complain about the fee if they only wanted to stop by and watch a game or a partial game and the fee might depress concession sales (which is where the Parks make money--the fees to use the fields cover the cost of preparing the fields). But with more teams coming for each tournament, the extra number of parents and players should more than offset the lost sales to those who are deterred by the entrance fee.</p><p>The Park Board also approved buying a sprinkler for the ball fields. Brianne Hooker from the Jasper-Newton Foundation said that she had donors who want to replace some of the playground equipment at Foundation Park and the Board encouraged her to support these efforts. The Board reviewed the accountant's report that showed that the Parks have operated in the black for the past four years. Softball should be getting started soon. Younger people seem to be uninterested in the sport. Pickleball has become popular at the new tennis courts.</p><p>Last week Brookside Park hosted a large group of students from the Kankakee Valley School system.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyzONwMw0a1OXGVczsh0NNcv-BW6G3Sd5pEh-_peY/s1280/KV_in_parkIMG_0489.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyzONwMw0a1OXGVczsh0NNcv-BW6G3Sd5pEh-_peY/w640-h480/KV_in_parkIMG_0489.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>When I took the photo above I wondered what the purpose of the fencing was. I figured it out on Saturday when I stopped by to look at the baseball games.<br /><p><b>Commissioners meeting</b></p><p>Near the beginning of the Commissioners meeting on Monday morning, Mr Bontreger mentioned the proposed carbon sequestration project. BP is apparently planning a test well to explore the rocks that lie beneath us. Newton County did not have the seismic testing that was done in Jasper County not because of something that their County government did but because there was data from the testing done before the landfill was put in and it apparently showed that the rock structures were too thin for significant CO2 storage. The Commissioners continue talking with BP and think that respectful dialogue is best at this point. All three commissioners oppose the project.</p><p>The meeting then proceeded with routine business. Two buried cable permits were approved for Carpenter Township and Remington,. The Commissioners approved lease contracts for postage machines for the Courthouse, Sheriff's Department, and the annex. New employee hours in the Health Department were approved as well as two new vehicles financed from a fund that the State wants the Department to spend down. A request from EMS to hire a full-time administrative assistant was approved. The Director is part-time (he has a full-time job in Valparaiso) and the salary for the Director is budgeted for a full-time director. Most of the money for the administrative assistant will come from unused funds for the director. The new EMS building will have an open house on May 23 from 4:00 until 6:00.</p><p>The Commissioners approved some conference requests and a vacation-extension request. The Sheriff received permission to replace two jailers and an officer who is leaving the Department after 20 years to work at Purdue. The leak in the jail roof was found under one of the condensers. There was a discussion of whether it would be better to put the air-conditioning equipment on the ground rather than have it on the roof and the Sheriff was told to proceed with planning for that change. The Commissioners approved a new application for a COPS grant. Last year the application was not funded because other departments were judged to have greater need for the funding. The Corrections Department received permission to replace a correctional officer.&nbsp;</p><p>Two bids for outside contractor services were opened and both accepted. They allow the Highway Department to outsource work when the Department cannot perform it. The Commissioners accepted a bid of $2000 from Rensselaer Monuments to repair damage done by vandals in Makeever Cemetery. The County wants to transfer ownership to Newton Township and paperwork needs to be finished. The Commissioners also accepted proposals from Reliable Exterminators to service Corrections, EMS, and Animal Control.</p><p>In other business, it was noted that DeMotte is considering a speed limit for its buffer zone. The County Attorney said that they do not have the authority to do that, but they can make a request to the Commissioners. The Commissioners approved purchase of updated GPS equipment for the Surveyor's Office that will automate updating records.&nbsp;</p><p>Changes to the Solar Ordinance will be discussed in the May Plan Commission meeting. Among the many changes will be the elimination of the requirement to plant trees or bushes for screening. Instead the setbacks will be increased and the land in the setback will be used for crops. There is currently no provision for battery storage facilities; the changes add some.</p><p>At a previous meeting the County Coroner expressed concerns about the speed limits on SR-10 as it approaches and goes through Wheatfield He said the State had been unresponsive to his request and Wheatfield's request for change and wanted the Commissioners to add their support for changes. He also gave the Commissioners updated and improved plans for a new building he would like built to house the mortuary. EMA Director Karen Wilson wanted a vehicle for EMA and the Commissioners approved transferring one from the Sheriff;s Department.</p><p>A number of citizens sat through a couple of hours of the meeting waiting to make public comments and most were about the proposed carbon sequestration project that BP has proposed. One speaker said that her communication with State officials said that the County had considerable authority to regulate both a CO2 pipeline and wells. Another speaker suggested that the Commissioners draft a resolution stating that the Commissioners were opposed to carbon sequestration. Mr DeYoung then made a motion to have the Attorney Beaver draft to that effect. Mr Bontreger then asked what effect that would have on IBEC, which is currently sequestering CO2. They were apparently told that they had to do this or they would be shut down. Further, IBEC provides a major market for the corn grown in Jasper County, so what happens to them may affect the farmers. The motion was then tabled until May 20 and Mr Beaver was asked to determine exactly what the County can and cannot do with the issue of carbon sequestration. After almost 3 hours, the meeting was continued to May 20 at 8:30.</p><p><b>Other meetings</b></p><p>I was not paying attention to the time on Monday afternoon so arrived at the Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission meeting fifteen minutes late. The meeting was over by the time I got there. I learned that the Commission had approved $60,000 for Apple Seed. The cost of running the Appletree Center is a bit over $600,000 and the revenues are a bit under $400,000, so a bit more than $200,000 must be raised each year to keep the Center open. The money from the Redevelopment Commission fills about a quarter of the gap.</p><p>The other item on the agenda was the building on the corner of Clark and Cullen that was once a bottling plant. The Commission would like it demolished.</p><p>The Drainage Board met after the Commissioners meeting. They decided to reject a request for a variance that would allow a garage to be built on the right-of-way of a ditch. The Surveyor needs the right-of-way if the ditch is cleaned. This issue had been discussed at previous meetings. They approved a request for a culvert placement and approved a fiber-cable request to cross County drains in Remington. A homeowner wanted three 18-inch culverts removed from a neighbor's driveway because she said the runoff was threatening the foundation of her house. After some discussion, Mr DeYoung told her to arrange a meeting with the adjoining property owner or owners and&nbsp; together with him, the Surveyor, and the Highway Department, a solution would be worked out. A woman had a question about her drainage bill and was told that the overcharge was due to the computer program used by the Auditor and Treasurer. She was told to take the matter to their offices.</p><p><b>Brick street pictures</b></p><p>Work continues on the Brick Street project.

The goodie bag had some pens, some popcorn, a fan that folded up in a funny way, and a coupon for a free cookie at McDonalds. I used the coupon and was surprised that there were no customers inside. I asked the lady who waited on me how much business is through the drive-up and she said over 80%.

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
