A lot needed more practice.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Board of Public Works meeting</b></p><p>In its meeting on Monday afternoon, the Rensselaer Board of Public Works &amp; Safety approved two applicants for the Fire Department. It then approved paying four invoices, two from Commonwealth Engineering for $9,607 and $12,331, and two from Maguire Iron for $162,685 and $$20,550. Work on the Drexel water tower is not finished. The work that is being done is inside the tank.</p><p>The Board then approved moving forward with an engineering agreement with Commonwealth for the long-term sewage control plan. This plan will have three sections, the waste-water treatment plant, an interceptor line, and relining the Melville sewer. The goal is to have it finished to have bids by April and close with the State Revolving Fund (SRF) by June. I did not catch the amount of the agreement.</p><p>Finally, the Board approved using funds left over from the water project to replace the water main along McKinley from Angelica to Vine and to also replace some lead service lines. The section of the water main along McKinley is a problem section that has had several leaks. The use of funds also needs SRF approval.</p><p><b>Rensselaer City Council meeting</b></p><p>Half an hour after the start of the BPW meeting started, the Rensselaer City Council met. After the usual preliminaries, the Major asked for citizens' comments and got one. A woman wants an ordinance that closes to vehicles undeveloped alleys, where the City owns the land but there is no roadway. Her concern comes from a neighbor who insists he has a right to drive down the undefined alley and may be driving on her property. The City will investigate her problem.</p><p>Next the Council had a public hearing on the proposed closing of the Scott Street rail crossing. Only one citizen spoke, asking why the City wanted to close the crossing. The City will receive about $80,000 from CSX for closing the crossing and would like to use the funds to pave the area around the depot and fix the drainage in that area. The Scott Street crossing does not have a stop light, unlike other crossings. Once closed, the City will not be able to reopen it. The vote on this matter will be taken at the next Council meeting.</p><p>Community Services, which operates the only public transportation service in Jasper County, would like the City to provide $12,000 as it did last year to support its transportation services. 95% of the trips it makes are in Rensselaer and it charges only $1 for a trip. It has 9 vehicles and will be getting a new one at the beginning of the year funded by a grant but must provide a cash match. The Council took no action at this meeting.</p><p>The Street Department had sought bids to remove 29 trees, 26 in City right-of-ways and three in the Cemetery. The low bid was from Timber Tree Service for $22,715 and the Council approved accepting the bid.</p><p>The Chief of Police would like a revision to the golf-cart ordinance so that only golf carts will be registered and not UTVs (utility task vehicles). He would like the ordinance to grandfather in UTVs that have already been registered but not allow any new ones. No action was taken at this meeting because the item was meant only for discussion.</p><p>The Council received an AMI metering update. AMI stands for Advanced metering&nbsp; infrastructure and the meters are smart meters, able to communicate with the utility, allowing the supplier to catch problems quickly. Most or most of the electrical and water customers have AMI metering, but there are no plans at present to do gas. Installation of AMI meters is ahead of schedule.</p><p>The Council approved Grimmer pay request #7 of $211,504.50 for work on the Brick Streets project. The project is finishing up with items from a punch list being addressed. The Council passed the 2025 budget. It transferred $74,000 from this year's budget to the rainy-day fund. It did not pass the 2025 salary ordinance because there were still some changes to be made for on-call work. The gas tracker for October is a 1.5&#162; decrease per hundred cubic feet.</p><p>The Council approved spending $250 for a ribbon cutting event at Filson Park on October 24. There will be pumpkin carving and other events including a free movie after. There will be a second ribbon cutting on the 24th, this one at about 7:00 at the fire station for the new training tower.</p><p>Mr Watson commented that a truck being used by the water department was embarrassing and told them to seek bids for a new truck. New police cars have been delivered and are being made ready for service. About 400 people attended the open house at the fire station last week. The burn ban has been extended for another seven days. The electric department sent people to the area hit by Helene to help restore power. The leaf vac is ready to start picking up leaves. Letters to homeowners with lead service lines will be sent in the next few weeks. The Council approved the Cemetery purchasing two mowers from next year's budget.</p><p><b>Jasper County Council meeting</b></p><p>&#8232;At Tuesday's meeting the Jasper County Council approved its 2025 meeting schedule with meetings at 6:00 on the third Tuesday of each month. It then moved up approving the budget of the Rensselaer Central School Corporation so the representatives could attend the School Board meeting that also meets on third Tuesday evenings. The current enrollment in the Corporation is 1438. The Corporation recently closed on a bond with a lower-than-expected interest rate of just under 3%.</p><p>&#8232;Returning to order on the agenda, the Council approved a memorandum of understanding with the Jasper County Soil &amp; Water Conservation District about the splitting the salary of an employee of the District. It then heard from the Prosecutor, Jacob Taulman, about the salary of the 4th deputy. The person in that position is leaving for a much higher salary. The salary is listed at $57K in the salary ordinance, which is considerably less than the salaries that will be paid to part-time public defenders and may not be enough to attract qualified applicants. After discussion of what the salary should be, the Council passed a motion to allow up to $96k. That will be put in the Salary Ordinance in December and an additional appropriation will have to be made next year.</p><p>&#8232;The Council held two public hearings. The first was to modify the local option income tax rate. The Council wanted to increase the amount going to Emergency Medical Services and reduce the amount going to the stabilization fund. (The Stabilization Fund is money the State withholds from the County so that if there is a year with unusually low tax receipts, the County budget will not have to drastically shrink.) In the discussion, a citizen pointed out that the numbers that the President of the Council read were not the same as those published in the newspaper. The changes passed with the note that the advertised numbers were incorrect.</p><p>&#8232;The second public hearing was to modify the property tax credit rate allocations between the three property tax classifications. I did not understand this item or the discussion. The three classifications are 1) homesteads; 2) residential, agricultural, long-term care, and other tangible property; and 3) nonresidential real property, personal property and other tangible property. The first two had their credit slightly increased and the third slightly decreased.</p><p>The Sheriff came to the meeting late because he did not realize that the Council had changed its start time to 6:00 from 7:00. He noted that the price of meal service is increasing. He said that his department has had eight deer-car accidents and as a result of this and some other factors, he will need more in his auto budget to finish the year.

After approving minutes and five claims, it approved a declaratory resolution that does three things. It enlarges the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area, it establishes the Van Elementary Residential Allocation Area, and it amends and restates the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area. This is part of the process to create a residential TIF area to develop the area north of the Van Rensselaer School. It is also only a start to a process. The matter now goes to the Plan Commission, then the City Council, and finally back to the Redevelopment Commission.</p><p>JCEDO reported on the façade grant program. Top Link and Earth Magic have completed their work and have been reimbursed 50% of their costs. Shanley Construction has completed its work but has not yet submitted the required paperwork for reimbursement. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=934219152081242&amp;set=a.466096222226873" target="_blank">latest grant has been awarded</a> to the new owner of what is called the "Carriage House."

This was the first meeting at which Heather Hall was present from the beginning as Park Superintendent.</p><p>Several guests were recognized and talked about their concerns. Soccer is still concerned about the grass where the old Monnett school was located. 230 kids signed up for the Fall program. Greg Whaley gave an update on the Miniature Train Proposal. A recent Redevelopment Commission meeting provided some money to have some architectural plans prepared, and these were distributed and discussed. No action was taken.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8DmFGq0QLt7VDrpfINCZirLrGsCt1L2NYKawuerRtGVFs1wQX5HBGNwVLdEJNP0lmcoG0B7jTCfUlj0a0lWv6-HpX7aOKDVHwhrw2XZE9ogAnuRwuG3q5R7I0iV5-8_QkgrQQqeIe9GM75BrZMMg4qk/s1280/Plans.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1271" data-original-width="1280" height="636" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8DmFGq0QLt7VDrpfINCZirLrGsCt1L2NYKawuerRtGVFs1wQX5HBGNwVLdEJNP0lmcoG0B7jTCfUlj0a0lWv6-HpX7aOKDVHwhrw2XZE9ogAnuRwuG3q5R7I0iV5-8_QkgrQQqeIe9GM75BrZMMg4qk/w640-h636/Plans.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>Mrs Hall asked if there were bylaws for either the Park Board or the Rensselaer Community Recreational Development Corporation. (Park Board meeting include both groups that have somewhat different members.) There will be a search for them.</p><p>Filson Park is at substantial completion. Left to finish are the street lights, concrete caps on the fountain and behind the stage, benches, and an arch over the entryway. Next week the Prairie Arts Council will install an art work and the bird that sits by eMbers will also be added. Rental prices for the shelter and the park have not yet been determined. There will be a ribbon cutting and various activities on October 24 from 4:00 until 7:30 on October 24.</p><p>Project underway or soon to be underway include some facilities upgrades. LaRue Pool may get a facelift and perhaps a slide. Mrs Hall would like to have the mural wrap around the whole building. A pickle ball league has been established. The old tennis courts at Brookside will be moved a bit to the east and converted to four pickle ball courts. This project has received a substantial donation from a Jackson family. The Board approved moving forward with this project and now it is in the lap of the City.&nbsp; It may take some time to figure out the best uses for the old power plant.&nbsp;</p><p>The softball tournament scheduled for this weekend at the Blacker Fields has been canceled. Not enough teams signed up.</p><p><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Jasper County Tourism Commission met on Tuesday morning. It heard a presentation from a person from <a href="https://www.travelindiana.com/" target="_blank">Travel Indiana</a>, which publishes a quarterly tourism magazine. It prints 30,000 copies that are distributed across Indiana and also has a web site promoting tourism. The Commission is considering advertising in the magazine but no decision has been reached yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://thecarnegieplayers.org/" target="_blank">Carnegie Players</a> had a request for $25,000 to help renovate its building at 220 N Franklin Street. The building needs a new roof, new windows, and a ramp to make it handicapped accessible. At present the Carnegie Players do not have permanent home and whatever venue is available. One of their problems is rehearsal space. The best space in Rensselaer is the auditorium at the High School, but t is used by the high school for three plays a year, the new middle school theater group for one, and Fendig Theater in the summer. Rehearsal before a production can take two months, so there is not a lot of time left to share at the high school. The Carnegie Players' building can have at least two rehearsal sites and the Players are willing to share them with others in the community.

The Commission approved $1500.</p><p><b>Airport Authority Board meeting</b></p><p>The Airport Authority Board met Tuesday evening. They discussed a planned land swap that has a verbal agreement but the details need to be finalized. They also discussed plans for a new nine-unit hangar that will probably be built in 2025. They have been accumulating the funds for this for four years and it the hangar is not built soon some of those funds will go away. A lot of what the Airport does is determined by the rules and regulations of various Federal and State bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>The old hangar building along the taxiway needs to come down but there are no plans yet of when and what will be done on that site. Fuel sales were very strong in September. There was discussion of various maintenance issues and of things not working properly. The meeting lasted a bit less than an hour.</p><p><b>New art exhibit</b></p><p>There is new exhibit at the Fendig Gallery, the Jasper County Art League's Annual Member Show.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the administration of a grant of $157,945.77 that the Forestry Council had recently received.</p><p>The funding of the grant ultimately came from the Federal government. The Inflation Recovery Act allocated $1.5 billion to be used for trees, and Indiana's share of that&nbsp; was $4 million. The Indiana DNR awarded 16 grants. The Rensselaer grant was awarded to the Rensselaer Urban Forestry Council and it will be administered by the Jasper-Newton Foundation over the next three years. The grant will fund a database of trees on City property and right-of-ways, community outreach to encourage people to appreciate trees and plant them in their yards, and the planting of 50 trees on City right-of-ways. The grant proposal that was submitted requested support for 100 trees, but the DNR cut that to 50 so the other activities could be supported. Much of the hour-long discussion was about the details of grant administration.</p><p>Below the people attending the meeting pose in front of the tulip tree behind the Carnegie Center.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOotYLWsR1Hiu_oICg7wmeAnFoGyXZZKC48lB9_L0OWBag8r8KdYq7AuonR5OgsLiU_46whcEh__AvIgv0H4pV0dBEkAoDBfrpduPxqK5Sx2JXcOikrY8TB-ThxI21AkIgWNtVakwVClr6u6OdZfX9hulubCn7NzNF0vjC_ayPjrMc5IlyWyofMEpuj7I/s1280/trees1387.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1104" data-original-width="1280" height="552" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOotYLWsR1Hiu_oICg7wmeAnFoGyXZZKC48lB9_L0OWBag8r8KdYq7AuonR5OgsLiU_46whcEh__AvIgv0H4pV0dBEkAoDBfrpduPxqK5Sx2JXcOikrY8TB-ThxI21AkIgWNtVakwVClr6u6OdZfX9hulubCn7NzNF0vjC_ayPjrMc5IlyWyofMEpuj7I/w640-h552/trees1387.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission met on Monday evening to discuss a proposed residential housing development program. The plan includes a new TIF district that will have a small area from which taxes will be collected and a fairly large area on the east side of Rensselaer in which the revenues can be spent. The areas that will collect taxes from new development are two blocks north of Van Rensselaer School and a strip of land north of Elm Street and south of the Melt Blown company. Spending can be done for road improvements and sidewalks, utility improvements, parks, public safety, and education. No vote was taken. I believe the vote will be during the October 7 meeting.

(It was the&nbsp;<i>first Noelle</i>&nbsp;led meeting.) The first order of business was a public hearing on the 2025 budget. Miss Keyes read the numbers for each of the funds. There were no comments so the regular meeting resumed. The vote on the budget will be at the next meeting.</p><p>The electric tracker for the final quarter will be an increase of $142 per 1000 kilowatt hours, or about $1.00 on the average monthly bill.&nbsp;</p><p>The American Legion will be hosting its 36th annual Thanksgiving dinner. Last year they served 720 meals, about one half delivered. Last year the Council approved a grant of $500 for this event. This year the amount was raised to $600 to account for inflation.</p><p>Grimmer pay request #6 of $326,430.54 for its work on the Brick Street Project was approved. Left to be finished is striping, some brick work, landscaping, and asphalt at the ends of the bricks.&nbsp; The Council also approved signing a contract with First Group for paperwork and various other tasks need for the CCMG grant of almost a million dollars to fund road repair in the City. The Council then approved another contract, with Mr Armold voting against, for work in design, permitting, construction monitoring for work around the Amtrak Station. Money for this will come from Amtrak and CSX but only if the City closes the Scott Street crossing.</p><p>In comments from the superintendents, Police Chief Anderson said he is preparing a revised golf-cart ordinance for the next meeting. Mr Davis said the meeting on the 14th will have a public hearing for the closing of the railroad crossing. The Redevelopment Commission will meet on September 30 for a hearing on a residential TIFF and hold a regular meeting on October 7. Fire Chief Haun said that the containers for the fire tower are arriving and will be assembled this week. He asked the Council to approve a $9240 claim for concrete work needed before the tower was erected and it was approved. He had attended a class on EV fires and said that when they burn, they emit toxic fumes and the area around the fire should be evacuated, perhaps for days. The recommended action was to cool the vehicles enough so they can be moved out of town and allowed to burn out. Letting them burn was cheaper than attempting to put out the fire. He also suggested that the City create an ordinance requiring a cut-off switch for charging stations.&nbsp; There will be a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122175380366183430&amp;set=a.122097731960183430" target="_blank">hazardous waste collection event</a>&nbsp;on Saturday, September 28 from 8:00 to noon at the Jasper County Highway Garage.</p><p>Plans are being developed for the extension of water and sewer to the west of I-65. The final 2024 tournament for the Blacker fields will be a girls softball tournament on October 5-6.</p><div><b>Odds and ends</b></div><div><p>A <a href="https://iedc.in.gov/events/news/details/2024/09/19/northwest-indiana-plans-nation-s-first-sports-complex-focused-on-empowering-girls-sports" target="_blank">proposed development in Newton County</a> may affect Rensselaer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marvella sports complex (Mavella was the wife of Birch Bayh) will offer facilities for girls sports at Fair Oaks Farms in Newton County. The entire complex will cost an estimated $98 million, with the first phase costing about $38.8 million. Construction is expected to start this fall. Because it is in Newton County, the project has not come before any County boards and so I do not know more about it than what I can find on the Internet. It might put some guests into Jasper County hotels.</p><p>The Memories Alive at Weston Cemetery event took place this past weekend. Below a group hears about the life and times of Truitt Parker Wright, who was the County Coroner long, long ago from the present County Coroner, and in the background another group hears about Emmet Kannal.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbY014-UkJfts-Cl9US2KWmxQ6WgpJwtDC7eCm3OtwR1_9n2BL21ZF2Rinpodv1qQqnDfTxzwi10qbsSLWTwNDph78SbT6jat3SFE3p65u9qyzAOF0YmNNcTG6cxVQCE00gIoVnVpaoAFkCs-zRw7SBXsvvGGTfxtrCiZ8gJycHZfkLdKgfNDPGvWWtms/s1280/memoriesAlive1283.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="810" data-original-width="1280" height="406" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbY014-UkJfts-Cl9US2KWmxQ6WgpJwtDC7eCm3OtwR1_9n2BL21ZF2Rinpodv1qQqnDfTxzwi10qbsSLWTwNDph78SbT6jat3SFE3p65u9qyzAOF0YmNNcTG6cxVQCE00gIoVnVpaoAFkCs-zRw7SBXsvvGGTfxtrCiZ8gJycHZfkLdKgfNDPGvWWtms/w640-h406/memoriesAlive1283.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The program for this year's Walk can be found <a href="http://ingrimayne.com/RENCEMWLK/Walking_Tour2024.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
