<p><b>Ribbon Cutting for the Brick Streets</b></p><p>On Thursday morning a ribbon cutting was held for the Brick Streets Project.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="b-hbp-video b-uploaded" frameborder="0" height="491" id="BLOGGER-video-4bd515bcfa7e3beb-14709" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" src="../../../www.blogger.com/video6cd8.html?token=AD6v5dzIDPdsIDqd9EwiDqKNc4hZ186mrbEFazo-0vRDuI1MhY21sPbc1Ur0JR2L4COEFr-fgmyaKNkQmwGD7eG2KXWPlIO-NLjuI6v1MQWd13fZNby5F9C_FZzHQpc5M7Ws1SGaXQl9" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" width="590"></iframe></div>Before the scissors came out, there were several speakers who thanked the many people who contributed to this project, which was years in the making. Among speakers was Mayor Phillips, former Mayor Wood, Congressman Baird, a representative for Senator Braun, State Senator Niemeyer, State Represenative Kendall Culp, and representatives from Kimley Horn, KIRPC, and EDA.<div><br /></div><div>There was a surprisingly large crowd.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5HJzpR5hyphenhyphenudAj0GSBHN_JRaAow7kOd/s1280/crowdIMG_1487.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5HJzpR5hyphenhyphenudAj0GSBHN_JRaAow7kOd/w640-h480/crowdIMG_1487.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>After the event, people could eat donuts. They left a lot, which were then served at the Customer Appreciation Lunch in City Hall from 11:00 until 1:00. The attendance there, at least when I went, was quite small.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhByRp5Elu6H4GiOPBiQVW915fsxRA0Gqn12KXULR-/s1280/donuts1484.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="771" data-original-width="1280" height="386" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhByRp5Elu6H4GiOPBiQVW915fsxRA0Gqn12KXULR-/w640-h386/donuts1484.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p><b>Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission met Monday evening. After approving minutes and five claims, it approved a declaratory resolution that does three things. It enlarges the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area, it establishes the Van Elementary Residential Allocation Area, and it amends and restates the Drexel/Fairgrounds Economic Development Area. This is part of the process to create a residential TIF area to develop the area north of the Van Rensselaer School. It is also only a start to a process. The matter now goes to the Plan Commission, then the City Council, and finally back to the Redevelopment Commission.</p><p>JCEDO reported on the façade grant program. Top Link and Earth Magic have completed their work and have been reimbursed 50% of their costs. Shanley Construction has completed its work but has not yet submitted the required paperwork for reimbursement. The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=934219152081242&amp;set=a.466096222226873" target="_blank">latest grant has been awarded</a> to the new owner of what is called the "Carriage House." (Old maps identify this as used for storage so I do not know the source of the Carriage-House name.)</p><p>Below you can see the two new porch columns of the Mr Shanley added to the <a href="../../2023/06/a-tour-of-mansion.html" target="_blank">Forsythe mansion.</a>&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9FCMIjVFtWByaBXjHMcNmSQS66Ro3aZnvSMerFlw/s1280/FacadeForthsyeIMG_1205.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9FCMIjVFtWByaBXjHMcNmSQS66Ro3aZnvSMerFlw/w640-h480/FacadeForthsyeIMG_1205.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Park Board also met on Monday evening and the meeting has so many people attending it was moved from the conference room at City Hall to the Council Chambers. This was the first meeting at which Heather Hall was present from the beginning as Park Superintendent.</p><p>Several guests were recognized and talked about their concerns. Soccer is still concerned about the grass where the old Monnett school was located. 230 kids signed up for the Fall program. Greg Whaley gave an update on the Miniature Train Proposal. A recent Redevelopment Commission meeting provided some money to have some architectural plans prepared, and these were distributed and discussed. No action was taken.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8Dm/s1280/Plans.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1271" data-original-width="1280" height="636" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiyd0Sm_oQIFbu9qlQsVq6H5ztFPioIzfcpfskA8Dm/w640-h636/Plans.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>Mrs Hall asked if there were bylaws for either the Park Board or the Rensselaer Community Recreational Development Corporation. (Park Board meeting include both groups that have somewhat different members.) There will be a search for them.</p><p>Filson Park is at substantial completion. Left to finish are the street lights, concrete caps on the fountain and behind the stage, benches, and an arch over the entryway. Next week the Prairie Arts Council will install an art work and the bird that sits by eMbers will also be added. Rental prices for the shelter and the park have not yet been determined. There will be a ribbon cutting and various activities on October 24 from 4:00 until 7:30 on October 24.</p><p>Project underway or soon to be underway include some facilities upgrades. LaRue Pool may get a facelift and perhaps a slide. Mrs Hall would like to have the mural wrap around the whole building. A pickle ball league has been established. The old tennis courts at Brookside will be moved a bit to the east and converted to four pickle ball courts. This project has received a substantial donation from a Jackson family. The Board approved moving forward with this project and now it is in the lap of the City.&nbsp; It may take some time to figure out the best uses for the old power plant.&nbsp;</p><p>The softball tournament scheduled for this weekend at the Blacker Fields has been canceled. Not enough teams signed up.</p><p><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Jasper County Tourism Commission met on Tuesday morning. It heard a presentation from a person from <a href="https://www.travelindiana.com/" target="_blank">Travel Indiana</a>, which publishes a quarterly tourism magazine. It prints 30,000 copies that are distributed across Indiana and also has a web site promoting tourism. The Commission is considering advertising in the magazine but no decision has been reached yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://thecarnegieplayers.org/" target="_blank">Carnegie Players</a> had a request for $25,000 to help renovate its building at 220 N Franklin Street. The building needs a new roof, new windows, and a ramp to make it handicapped accessible. At present the Carnegie Players do not have permanent home and whatever venue is available. One of their problems is rehearsal space. The best space in Rensselaer is the auditorium at the High School, but t is used by the high school for three plays a year, the new middle school theater group for one, and Fendig Theater in the summer. Rehearsal before a production can take two months, so there is not a lot of time left to share at the high school. The Carnegie Players' building can have at least two rehearsal sites and the Players are willing to share them with others in the community. It also wants to coordinate with other arts groups in scheduling so their events do not complete. A donor is matching donations for the roof. The Commission approved the entire ask of $25,000.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXXSPcmQ9r_pljtq-TXLy2Oqcb-bdqtWLR1yWBy3T/s1280/TheaterBuilding1203.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="605" data-original-width="1280" height="302" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXXSPcmQ9r_pljtq-TXLy2Oqcb-bdqtWLR1yWBy3T/w640-h302/TheaterBuilding1203.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Fountain Park Chautauqua asked for $5000 to bring <a href="https://www.purduealumnus.org/the-piano-man/alumni/" target="_blank">Bruce Barker The Piano Man</a> to the Chautauqua. They did not have a representative to present the case and answer questions. One Commission member suggested that the admission price of $5 was too low. The Commission approved $1500.</p><p><b>Airport Authority Board meeting</b></p><p>The Airport Authority Board met Tuesday evening. They discussed a planned land swap that has a verbal agreement but the details need to be finalized. They also discussed plans for a new nine-unit hangar that will probably be built in 2025. They have been accumulating the funds for this for four years and it the hangar is not built soon some of those funds will go away. A lot of what the Airport does is determined by the rules and regulations of various Federal and State bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>The old hangar building along the taxiway needs to come down but there are no plans yet of when and what will be done on that site.

Then there was a followup post saying that maybe enough people were stepping up so they could continue. Read about this on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61550059768852" target="_blank">Facebook page.</a></p><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Park Board usually meets only once a month but had a second August meeting when it met Monday evening at 5:00 at the old light plant. The main item on the agenda was Mayor Phillips' reassignment of positions. He had decided to replace Joe Effinger with Heather Hall as Park Superintendent. He had previously appointed Mr Effinger to the position of Weston Cemetery Caretaker and Effinger will retain that position. However, the Mayor needed Park Board approval to the change the Park Superintendent. Only three Board members were present, a bare quorum. There were a number of questions about the transition, including how accounting and other paperwork issues would be handled. There was also discussion of what changes would be needed or desired to make the old light plant a suitable Park headquarters. The current bathroom may not be sufficient and the building should be made ADA compliant. The City is including an extra $100,000 in next year's budget to help make these changes as well as repair the sidewalk in front of the building. Mrs Hall said she would like to see the building used as a recreation center. Perhaps the remodeled building will encourage cooperative programming with the Library. There are many details that have to be worked out and there will be learning by doing. After a lot of discussion, all three members present voted to accept the change in the superintendent.</p><p>The meeting continued but about half of the people present, including the old and new park superintendents, left for the City Council meeting which started at 6:00.

Its first item of business was to move about $72,000 from this year's budget to next year's budget. It also approved a couple of transfers of funds. It approved spending $5,000 for consultants to review City policies and procedures to make sure they are current with State and Federal regulations. The Council approved the Electric Utility signing an interdepartmental agreement with the Park Department concerning use of the light plant and responsibility for utility bills. (The Park Board wanted more time to consider the agreement.)&nbsp;</p><p>The City has been in discussion with CSX and Amtrak about paving the area around the depot and closing the Scott Street railroad crossing. Final details have not been worked out and the Council opted to delay a vote on the matter.</p><p>The Council approved paying invoice #5 of $145,566.90 from Grimmer Construction for work on the Brick Street project. It also gave the Gas Utility permission to prepay $13468 for gutters and downspouts for its building. New squad cars for the Police Department have been ordered. Five employees have recently received CDL licenses.</p><p><b>Parking-lot art</b></p><p>I am a <a href="mid%20June%20Emma%20goes%20to%20a%20summer%20camp%20in%20Arizona%20Matthew%20attends%20a%20leadership%20camp%20in%20Utah%20and%20earns%20a%20trip%20to%20Washington%20in%202025%20Matthew%20flies%20with%20an%20older%20pilot%20to%20the%20Oshkosh%20Air%20Show%20Aug" target="_blank">little late this year</a> with the painted parking lot spaces at the high school.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

<p><b>Chamber luncheon at the Ritz</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Chamber of Commerce held its August luncheon at the Ritz Theater. Nancy Klockhow, the owner of the Theater, gave a brief history of the theater, which has had several owners since it was built in 1928. Covid and the construction of the Brick Streets Project have both hurt her business, so she is only showing movies on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. She had tales of ghosts in the theater and there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6dIpeshtvY" target="_blank">long video on Youtube of ghost hunters visiting the Ritz</a>.</p><p>Judy Kanne gave a report of the local Historical Society's application to get a State historical marker honoring Charles Halleck. He was born in DeMotte and DeMotte is the proposed site for the marker. Paul Norwine and several of his KV students did some of the research work included in the application. Halleck was born in 1900 so next year will be his 125 birthday and perhaps that may help the application chances of being accepted. It is one of 34 applications for a historical marker.</p><p>Do you know where historical markers are in Jasper County? There are three in Rensselaer.

I had considered attending in person but was tired, so opted to attend via Zoom. Executive sessions, which often discuss personnel performance, are closed to the public, so I logged in at 5:45 and waited. They must have had a lengthy discussion of personnel because the Finance meeting did not start until almost 6:00.</p><p>The Finance meeting discussed the tradeoff between liquidity and return. If one wants a higher return, usually one must lose liquidity. So they discussed with their financial advisor how much to have in a money-market account and how much to put in various maturities of T-bills or T-notes. The Airport has a substantial amount of financial assets and because they are a government entity, they are limited in how they can invest those assets. All of this is complicated right now because the Country has an inverted yield curve and most prognosticators expect interest rates to fall in the year ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;The regular meeting opened with an update on the master plan that is being prepared by consultants and that is being approved chapter by chapter by the FAA. This plan is needed for future funding from the FAA. The Airport would like to acquire land to its west for an east-west runway and would like to exchange that land for land it owns along SR 114 that could be valuable for future commercial development. There is a possibility that such an exchange may be arranged. There were discussions of insurance and maintenance for the rental plane as well as Airport minutiae that goes with the day-to-day operations. The Airport manager would like to renovate the bathrooms in the terminal building. The Board approved a pay raise for the assistant manager, probably a result from the executive session. The helicopter rides in July largely flopped because of weather but the biplane rides did very well.&nbsp;</p><p>There are seven students enrolled in the airport class for this semester, three from RCHS, 3 from KV, and 1 from SN. This past summer the Airport had four interns; next year it will hire only one. The Board discussed the budget for next year and considered two options; they voted to approve option 2. They ended the meeting with a discussion of switching cell-phone providers for the Airport.</p></div>

<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
