The wind causes his perch high in the sky to sway.</p><p><b>Joint Commissioner/Council meeting</b></p><p>The County Commissioners and Council met in a joint meeting on Tuesday evening. They heard a report from Valley Oaks, a mental health and substance abuse provider. They served 650 people in the County last year and have 30 employees in Jasper County. They have staff in the County school systems and claimed that 12 kids who graduated this year had needed their help sometime in their student years. They have made significant changes since the last time they addressed the Commissioners and Council. They no longer have a wait list but have open access. They have a mobile crisis unit operated with Phoenix Paramedical that operates in the 9 counties they serve. In Lafayette they are opening a primary care facility because people who suffer from mental health issues frequently have other health problems.&nbsp;</p><p>The County Coroner presented a preliminary estimate of the cost of a new morgue building, between $3.5 and $4.2 million. He told the story of recently finding a decomposing body in a car parked near a hotel by the Interstate and the problems of extracting the body, identifying the person, and getting a burial. He said he has had four cases of strangers or homeless people in the last three months and thought there should be clear procedures of how to handle these cases.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a discussion of how to fund EMS. About two thirds of the cost comes from the taxpayer and one third from payment for services. Any serious cases go to the big hospitals. There is a two-year wait time for a new ambulance.</p><p>The Commissioners have approved a study of the County's finances by Baker Tilly, which does these studies for many Indiana counties. There was a discussion of the need to replace the sidewalks around the Courthouse, especially the one along Cullen Street which is in awful shape. Later there was a brief discussion of partnering with the City of Rensselaer to provide a sidewalk from the City to the Fairgrounds if grant funding can be found.</p><p>There was a discussion of a new public defenders' office, including the cost of fringe benefits and where they could be located. One possibility is to use space currently used to store voting machines, but then a place for that storage would have to be found. Costs of the public defenders' office are compensated 40% by the State.</p><p>There was support for a more formal process to be used by entities applying for financing.</p><p>No actions were taken at this meeting because its purpose is to share information and opinions between the Commissioners and the Council.&nbsp;</p><p><b>County Council meeting</b></p><p>Much of the County Council meeting that followed the Joint meeting was for several large additional appropriations. The Commissioners earlier had approved a request from the Jail to move the chiller from the roof to the ground. The equipment is nearing end of life and uses freon, which can no longer be manufactured. The Council approved an appropriation of $700,000 for the project. Trane will serve as the general contractor and will seek bids for the various parts of the project. It also approved $50,000 for a five-year maintenance agreement for the x-ray machine used at the jail to search for illicit items of incoming prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A second large appropriation, this for $600,000, was approved for the renovation of the health department building. Some smaller additional appropriations were approved for software fees for the Recorder's Office.&nbsp;</p><p>An appropriation tabled at a previous meeting for the purchase of a trailer for the Health Department and moving some equipment around was also passed.</p><p>There were several tax abatements that should have been approved at this meeting, but only one, Dunns Bridge #1, had all the required paperwork submitted. It was approved. Others from REMC, FBI, and for a dairy digester were tabled until the next meeting, which will be the August 20 budget meeting. At that meeting the Council will also consider how the various parts of the Local Income Tax (LIT) can be moved around, reducing some parts to increase other parts.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Plan Commission meeting</b></p><p>There was one big item on the agenda of the Rensselaer Plan Commission meeting Thursday evening, a preliminary plat for St. Joseph's Building and Trades Subdivision. The map of the proposed subdivision, shown below, envisions 30 building sites with three cul-de-sacs off Sparling Avenue. The plan is to build one house a year, or if there are enough students interested, perhaps two. The plat was not approved but tabled because a technical review showed there were details that needed to be ironed out. However, the Commission approved granting a building permit for a first house to be located at the corner of Sparlng and Daugherty Roads.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBG2Ha5KveTwUSVqQWRZezR3Inw13-FAFI6GcRz6Z/s1881/subdivision0892.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1881" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBG2Ha5KveTwUSVqQWRZezR3Inw13-FAFI6GcRz6Z/w436-h640/subdivision0892.jpg" width="436" /></a></div>The project will have four phases. The first phase will build in the five lots along Daugherty Road. Then lots 6-14, followed by lots 15-23, and finally lots 24-30 will follow. I will not live long enough to see this project finished. (In case you do not know where this is located, it is south of the Health Department building, on the west side of Sparling Avenue, where the Halleck Center parking lot and the softball field were located.)<br /><p>A few years ago RCHS dropped its building trades practice of building a house each year and Saint Joe is trying to replace that program, opening it up to other schools. However, to be ready to build a house requires prior preparation in preliminary courses and those courses are lacking in some area schools and have apparently atrophied locally. It may take some time to build up this program. There may be only two or three students participating in the program for the coming year.</p><p>There will be a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=122161277912183430&amp;set=pcb.122161278518183430" target="_blank">ground-breaking ceremony</a> on Thursday, July 25 at 1:00. ( Also on the 25th but at 10:00, the Plevna Implement Company, which purchased what was the <a href="../../2014/08/groundbreaking-and-bugets.html" target="_blank">MacAllister facility</a> next to the Airport, is planning a grand opening.)</p><p>SJC seems to have adopted a new logo. (See the press release linked above.)</p><p>A few days ago a SJC alum posted on Facebook the picture of a sign I had <a href="../../2024/06/pictures-to-end-month-of-june.html" target="_blank">in a post at the end of June</a>. The sign said "Future Building Site of Saint Joseph's Building &amp; Trades". The alum interpreted that to mean SJC planned to build a building for the Building &amp;&nbsp; Trades program, not that the program planned to build houses. I am not sure that the people involved ever realized that their outrage was based on a misunderstanding.</p><p>Before the meeting, I was told that on Thursday the football team from Faith Christian High School in Lafayette was taking parts of the stands at the football field to transfer to their school. The entire stands will end up there.</p><p><b>Rensselaer BZA meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer BZA had an uneventful meeting Thursday evening. They approved another extension for a building permit for a house on Airport Road. The owner said her original contractor died, then she got cancer, and now it is very difficult to find people to do work. A building permit requires the house be finished n a year.</p><p>The BZA also approved a variance of use for a residence on E Washington. The property is in a business zone but has always been a residence. It is changing ownership and thus needs a new variance.&nbsp;</p><p>The zoning ordinance has too many rules and regulations.</p><p><b>Odds &amp; ends</b></p><p>Workers are filling Van Rensselaer with gravel to get it ready for the bricks.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpizoorjCoYB-hbj7kY1trnOxXT6hdLS0I3yljw3v/s1280/gradingIMG_0531.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpizoorjCoYB-hbj7kY1trnOxXT6hdLS0I3yljw3v/w640-h480/gradingIMG_0531.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieq6DjLRArGaBeXmdYM_aSzdNiKsHJAPMLDefGGKw/s1280/dumpingIMG_0536.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEieq6DjLRArGaBeXmdYM_aSzdNiKsHJAPMLDefGGKw/w640-h480/dumpingIMG_0536.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The merchants along Van Rensselaer have had a hard time during this construction. They will be very happy when it is finished.<div><br /></div><div>Our rains were not enough to get the River to minor flood stage; it missed by just a few inches.

It had excellent and very colorful costumes, energetic choreography, and was well cast. On Friday night I thought the sound track was too loud as it drowned out some of the solo singers but I was told that the volume was lower on Saturday. (In the distant past, they had a pit band. It would be nice to bring it back.)</p><p>Before the performance there was an announcement that people should not take pictures, so I did not. However, I have several pictures taken on Wednesday at a preview at the Cup of Joy Cafe, Too. Pictured below are Thing 2, Thing 1, Sour Kangaroo, and Horton the Elephant. The story is a mishmash of 15 books by Dr. Seuss, with most of the plot involving Horton.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1nbuDVw3XDvNegWgmOC1w2WcZkoxZy1dC5RgtIhy/s1280/suesicalIMG_0474.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1nbuDVw3XDvNegWgmOC1w2WcZkoxZy1dC5RgtIhy/w640-h480/suesicalIMG_0474.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The Cat in the Hat had a major role and did an excellent job.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD9HolTMyrp6DPa5HNNo7yuSZexNJ4IJk0s9DU6Qv/s1280/catInHat0472.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="1163" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD9HolTMyrp6DPa5HNNo7yuSZexNJ4IJk0s9DU6Qv/w582-h640/catInHat0472.jpg" width="582" /></a></div>Next year will be the 50th year for the Summer Theater. The first performance I saw was <i>The Hobbit</i>&nbsp;in 1978. It was, if I remember correctly, performed in the basement of St Augustine Church and they cut battle scenes because they seemed too violent. The first play one of my children was in was <i>Annie</i> in 1984. My kids were in crowd scenes or with only one or two lines, with one exception. A son played Winthrop in the <i>Music Man</i> (1992) and did an excellent job.<br /><p><b>Sidewalks</b></p><p>Almost all of the concrete work is finished for the Brick Street Project.

<p><b>&nbsp;Continued Commissioners meeting</b></p><p>The County Commissioners met in a continuation of their June meeting on Monday at 8:30 am. They approved the signing of a letter of commitment for FMLA training for department heads that will be done by outside consultants and will review Federal regulations. It may be scheduled for August. The Commissioners announced that BF&amp;S will be appointed construction compliance monitor for the proposed SolarPac solar farm and they approved a conference request from the County Clerk. Community Corrections had some fee increases that the Commissioners approved. The Commissioners also approved a printer lease agreement that they had discussed early in June but had neglected to vote on the matter.</p><p>They then held a public hearing for an ordinance to make the intersection of CR 800N and CR 400W a four-way stop. It currently has stop signs only on CR 800N. On May 22 an accident at this intersection left one young man dead and two others severely injured. About fifteen people spoke, all in favor of adding stop signs on CR 400W. Some had close relatives involved in the accident and were emotional. The intersection is apparently a blind intersection with bushes obscuring the view of those who stop on 800N. Some of the speakers said that there have been numerous accidents at this intersection and many people considered it dangerous. When everyone who wanted to speak had spoken, the Commissioners approved the ordinance. A stop sign will be put up immediately along with stop-ahead signs. When signs with solar-powered lights arrive, they will replace the conventional stop signs. Also, the County will remove obstructing bushes at no cost to the landowners if the landowners are willing to have them removed.</p><p>Before the people who had come for the public hearing left, Mr Bontreger told them if residents think there is a dangerous intersection, they should get a petition and have as many people as possible sign it. A petition is much more effective than a solo complaint. Most of the room cleared out but remained outside talking. The hearing and the aftermath seemed to be therapeutic for some of the people who came to the meeting.</p><p>The Sheriff was next on the agenda. He said he has a report showing where accidents have happened and will share it with the Commissioners and the Highway Department. He noted that traffic patterns are changing as the north of the County suburbanizes. The County has narrow right-of-ways along some roads that were originally lightly traveled.</p><p>The leak in the jail roof was due to the chiller on the roof. It is old and will soon need to be replaced and the Sheriff would like the new chiller to be on the ground where it would not cause roof damage. Trane has sought quotes for the project and it will cost about $725,000. The new chiller should have a life expectancy of 20 years. The best time to install it would be in the winter and the goal is to have it ready for next summer. There was a brief discussion of what fund to tap to make the change. The Commissioners passed a motion to proceed but the project needs the Council to appropriate the funds.</p><p>There was a discussion of how best to maintain the x-ray machine at the jail. One option is to pay for maintenance and repairs as needed and the other was to sign a five-year maintenance agreement for $50,000. The Commissioners passed a motion to sign the five-year contract pending Council approval.</p><p>To end the meeting the comments were read that had been submitted via the Internet but not read earlier in the month because that meeting had lasted so long. Most of the comments opposed solar and wind projects.</p><p><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b></p><p>The&nbsp; Tourism Commission held a second June meeting to discuss the proposed mural on the Rensselaer water tower at the SR-114/I-65 intersection. Some of the questions that had been raised at the first meeting were answered in an email that had been sent to members and the members had received a letter of support for the project from the City of Rensselaer. The project will be using special paint that is the same kind of paint used to paint the water tower. It is important to paint the mural while the tank is empty to avoid condensation issues and it is also important to paint it before the paint on the tower ages. The City of Rensselaer will help with funding. The members, most of whom were on Zoom, approved the proposal to spend $40,000 for this project.</p><p>Before the meeting adjourned there was a brief discussion of Placer AI. There was uncertainty of how it could be used given that there were legal constraints in the contract that do not allow the data to aid private businesses unless the data is in some kind of report. There were also questions if other companies could provide a similar service.</p><p><b>County Council meeting</b></p><p>The Jasper County Council met for its June meeting on Tuesday evening. They will use the same <a href="https://www.jaspercountyin.gov/egov/apps/action/center.egov?view=form;page=1;id=10" target="_blank">public comment form</a> that the Commissioners are using for those who cannot attend a meeting but want to comment on some matter.</p><p>The Council had several additional appropriations on its agenda. It approved $16,000 to purchase kitchen appliances for Community Corrections and $60,000 for an account used when the State Board of Accounts audits Jasper County government units. Much of the money paid out of this account will be reimbursed. An appropriation of $6,922.15 for equipment for the Surveyor was approved, as was $50,000 for start-up costs for the <strike>Convention</strike>&nbsp;Connection Center. The Convention Center appropriation raised concerns that it might invite other organizations to be requesting money for similar purposes. The big additional appropriation of the evening was $2,993,421.32 to help the City of Rensselaer extend sewer and water west of I-65. This funding comes from ARP funds that the County received and there is a time limit on when they must be spent.&nbsp;</p><p>The Council amended the Salary Ordinance to include a salary of a recently hired Deputy Sheriff. The next meeting will be on July 16, with a joint Commissioner/Council meeting before the regular Council meeting. Before adjournment there was a discussion of a need to tweak tax rates so that the money goes to funds that need more and away from funds that need less.</p><p><b>Odd and ends</b></p><p>The summer solstice is Thursday.</p><p>On Tuesday a concrete floor was being poured in the old light plant.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1Ocns5CU68mrtGB1ocWrZrESez8pqXfbjHFLpHEu/s1280/Concrete0166.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="608" data-original-width="1280" height="304" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1Ocns5CU68mrtGB1ocWrZrESez8pqXfbjHFLpHEu/w640-h304/Concrete0166.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>Over the weekend it appeared that the Brick Street project was ready to pour the sidewalk on Van Rensselaer next to the Court House.<div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF1q4kXTg35w4z75djvPREmmeLMPQ3jVc1g-CoUc4/s1280/sidewalksIMG_0147.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF1q4kXTg35w4z75djvPREmmeLMPQ3jVc1g-CoUc4/w640-h480/sidewalksIMG_0147.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>But the first bit of sidewalk poured was on the other side of the street.<br /><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgB07o51jPzibnWItBQRFnWeyOn6efQgkroxWYsPIM/s1280/newsidewalkIMG_0157.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgB07o51jPzibnWItBQRFnWeyOn6efQgkroxWYsPIM/w640-h480/newsidewalkIMG_0157.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>This week the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=384549517572066&amp;set=a.195698453123841" target="_blank">Rensselaer Regional Soccer Club has a camp</a> with out-of-town instructors.</div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLyOemjBmOcwx2t_dF3ldtvGCsFyonn35iLjhH9by/s1280/soccerCamp0164.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="491" data-original-width="1280" height="246" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLyOemjBmOcwx2t_dF3ldtvGCsFyonn35iLjhH9by/w640-h246/soccerCamp0164.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The LaRue Pool is open and is planning its first dollar day on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=873987431431930&amp;set=a.302743828556296" target="_blank">June 19</a>.

<p><b>&nbsp;Airport Authority meeting</b></p>The Jasper County Airport Authority met Tuesday evening and I attended in person rather than via Zoom. While the meeting was in progress, a large, strange aircraft landed. I was told that it was on the way to the UK. The company that owns it is developing hydrogen-electric engines but this plane runs on regular fuel.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheUNLxoONgpQYRU7EJODpOAOSgF-fij72piVGMnyE/s1280/aeroplane0119.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="530" data-original-width="1280" height="266" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheUNLxoONgpQYRU7EJODpOAOSgF-fij72piVGMnyE/w640-h266/aeroplane0119.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>At the meeting the Board heard from its engineers that a couple of reports had been submitted to the FAA and saw an updated plan for a new hangar. It is for a 214' by 60' building that will house eight planes. They heard a report about their investments in money-market funds and Treasury notes and bills. Someone is interested in land that the Airport owns along SR 114 but another estimate must be made before a sale can take place.<br /><br />The Board approved a new lease for a tenant in the old hangar building. Fuel sales were strong in May. The rental aircraft was damaged during a training flight and there was a long discussion of whether the rental policy needs to be modified. No action was taken but the airport manager will see how other airports handle damage by renters. The damage was light, only a bit more than $1000, and the Airport will cover it. There was a discussion of stumps from a line of trees that were removed; the ground is rocky and the stumps cannot be ground without damage to the grinder. Three insurance policy renewals were approved. There are eight students signed up for an airport class in the next school semester, four from RCHS, three from KVHS, and one from SNHS. The meeting ended with a discussion of maintenance on the rental plane.<br /><br />On the way to the meeting I noticed that the roads in the Fairgrounds had recently been seal coated.<br /><br /><b>Board of Public Works meeting</b><br /><br />The Rensselaer BPW met Monday afternoon and approved paying several bills from Commonwealth Engineering for work it has done: &nbsp;$10,335 on the water project, $20,000 for a preliminary engineering report required for SRF financing, and to bills of $5671 and 470.80 for work on the sewer project. The new water tower does not yet have its electrical work done and there is still work to be done on the existing water towers. The only other action it took was to approve fireworks at the Fair on July 27.<br /><br /><b>City Council meeting</b><br /><br />On Monday evening the Rensselaer City Council approved a request from Jasper County Tourism to paint a mural on the new water tower at the SR 114 and I-65 interchange. There was one member of the public who said that she preferred the water tower to remain without a mural. The project still needs some additional money to pay for the rental of the lift and for the clear coat layer.</div><div><br />The Council then had a second reading and approved three ordinances that were introduced at its previous meeting: ordinances establishing a redevelopment non-reverting fund, a Plan Commission non-reverting fund, and a fund for extending water and sewer to the west of I-65.</div><div><br />The gas tracker for June will reflect a 16&#162; increase per hundred cubic feet of use. The Council passed a resolution to document &nbsp;forgiving under-billed charges, a resolution that the State Board of Accounts wanted passed. The Council approved a pay request from Grimmer Construction of $295,863.85 for work on the Brick Street project and a request from Commonwealth Engineering of $32,448.25 for its work on this project. The Council approved a public relations request of $2000 for a City employee picnic at the end of July.</div><div><br />Some time this week concrete will be poured at the old light plant for a new floor. The space is being rehabilitated to become a new Park Department headquarters. There was a brief discussion about planning for the long-run future of the pool, but no action was taken.</div><div><br />This week work on the Brick Streets Project is construction of curbs and next week it should be on replacing sidewalks. There were five baseball tournaments scheduled for the Blacker Fields but the last two, scheduled for June, have been canceled. The new water main at the Fire Department has passed its tests. The Council approved having the Fair use a City garbage truck; this approval has been granted the last few years. The Council approved the Street Superintendent seeking bids for a new truck to pull the recycling trailer. Finally, the Council approved $8178 for a new flag pole to be installed in front of City Hall.</div><div><br /></div><div>Below are pictures of new the curbs taken on Tuesday. The corner of Van Rensselaer and Harrison will have a bump out.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTuGFKDoEmT9n5cBu4KcltH_ohl51PDeawhZzc_0I/s1280/bumpourIMG_0087.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTuGFKDoEmT9n5cBu4KcltH_ohl51PDeawhZzc_0I/w640-h480/bumpourIMG_0087.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The view from US 231.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEvPQq5dIOoifTdP6MaMSdYqMvpzqCc3tWmVR3JYf/s1280/curbIMG_0085.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEvPQq5dIOoifTdP6MaMSdYqMvpzqCc3tWmVR3JYf/w640-h480/curbIMG_0085.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b><br /><br />The Tourism Commission met on Tuesday morning. They approved a sponsorship the the Jasper County Historical Society's Memories Alive at Weston Cemetery, which will be held on September 21. This will be the seventh annual performance of this event. This year the focus will be on the eastern part of Weston Cemetery and as in the past few years will feature a morning program in the Hall Shelter of Brookside Park and an afternoon program in the Cemetery. An unofficial website for the event with past programs is <a href="http://ingrimayne.com/RENCEMWLK/" target="_blank">here</a>. (I am on the committee that plans this event.)<br /><br />The next item on the agenda was a funding request for painting a mural on the Rensselaer I-65 water tower. This project originated with JCEDO and the cost for painting the tower was estimated at $40,000, not including rental of a lift and applying a clear coat. There are two ways the Commission could fund this. It could come from the marketing budget. The mural is intended to highlight the murals that have been painted throughout Jasper County. JCEDO had been considering renting a billboard at a cost of $15,000 annually and had added money to the marketing budget. Alternatively, it could be funded as a capital project. Only the side of the tower facing the interstate will be painted.There was a discussion of how the costs were computed and eventually the members present decided they needed more information, so no action was taken at this meeting. Instead they plan to have another meeting, which members can attend via Zoom, next Tuesday (June 18) at 10:00.</div><div><br />The Commission approved joining the Indiana Tourism Association. It will provide networking opportunities and information about what other counties are doing. Two new employees were introduced, Angelica Potts-Bramlage who is in charge of Tourism and Community Development and Tori Smith who is an intern focused on publicity. Mrs Potts-Bramlage has previously worked in marketing for Indiana Beach and Fair Oaks Farms. Ms Smith is a recent grad from Ball State and will only be with Tourism until August when she leaves for Arizona to pursue graduate studies.</div><div><br />Finally the Commission heard a presentation from <a href="https://www.placer.ai/" target="_blank">Placer AI,</a> a company that specializes in location analytics. The company uses data from smartphones to track how many people visit just about any location in the US. They do not get the data from the carriers but from some of the apps that ask people to share their locations. They have data from about 30 million phones, which is about 9% of the U.S. population, and extrapolate from where these people are to estimate what everyone is. I was impressed with what they could show. They could select any area and tell how many people had visited that area during any time period in the last seven years. They could also tell where those people lived, where they worked, and what stores they shopped at. Using data from other sources, they could estimate incomes of the visitors and much else. The cost of an annual subscription for Jasper County Tourism would be about $26,000. The members of the Commission need to figure out how they might use the data that this company provides and whether it would be useful enough to justify the cost. No action was taken but the matter will probably be discussed further at their special meeting that the plan for next week.<br /><br /><b>Ag report</b><br /><br />The Farmers market has about as many vendors as it had last summer. I was interested in seeing what vegetables were available and found turnips, beets, onions, and greens in addition to the asparagus that was at the market when I stopped by a couple weeks ago. One vendor had tomatoes and summer squash that were grown in a hoop house in another county.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgH0f4e_fpSP3kg1Gk6iw9BTi1wxD8IX3Dm7hzYL2p/s1280/onionsIMG_0065.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgH0f4e_fpSP3kg1Gk6iw9BTi1wxD8IX3Dm7hzYL2p/w640-h480/onionsIMG_0065.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_tLnZ9CxwSPdLpbyaD8bcOJjCzhaSqREvc1tdHaY/s1280/turnipsIMG_0063.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_tLnZ9CxwSPdLpbyaD8bcOJjCzhaSqREvc1tdHaY/w640-h480/turnipsIMG_0063.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>I have harvested <a href="https://resprout.com/harvesting-garlic-scapes-when-why-how/" target="_blank">garlic scapes</a> in my garden and I did not see anyone offering that strange vegetable.</div><div><br /><div>The High School FFA had a booth.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-ioswxV2KCdd3VEPuozfwJQIntvKId0QHkzmyYId/s1280/FFA0066.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1006" data-original-width="1280" height="504" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-ioswxV2KCdd3VEPuozfwJQIntvKId0QHkzmyYId/w640-h504/FFA0066.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>A usual item for sale was freeze dried candy.

<p><b>Ceremonial Groundbreaking</b></p><p>The Brick Streets Project had its ceremonial groundbreaking on Tuesday morning. People involved in the project posed with a shovelful of dirt from plastic buckets.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1ggkUAEoA2mmaRTcOkWK8-10T2em8K-YPnIAI27b/s1280/shovels9899.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="601" data-original-width="1280" height="300" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1ggkUAEoA2mmaRTcOkWK8-10T2em8K-YPnIAI27b/w640-h300/shovels9899.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>Before the posed picture, there were short addresses by Mayor Phillips, Emily Albaugh the Community Development Planner for KIRPC, Brandon Schreeg from Kimley Horn, remarks read from State Representative Kendell Culp who is attending the legislative session in Indianapolis, and Stace Pickering from Rensselaer Main Street. KIRPC writes grant applications and administers grants for Rensselaer and Kimley Horn designed the project. Below you can see Ms Albaugh addressing the crowd with Jeff Phillips behind her and former Mayor Wood, former Councilman George Cover, and Stace Pickering in front of the shovels.<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEja2gjZCMUE8biQUUCEuZupAwQ2qqUhhKImM6P22W_/s1280/talksIMG_9882.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEja2gjZCMUE8biQUUCEuZupAwQ2qqUhhKImM6P22W_/w640-h480/talksIMG_9882.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>There was a decent sized crowd attending.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3IH3tZX2Gg-tFMJrODISTahxhgBKbmx5zY7JjtQ7/s1280/crowdIMG_9892.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3IH3tZX2Gg-tFMJrODISTahxhgBKbmx5zY7JjtQ7/w640-h640/crowdIMG_9892.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>Here are two sketches of what the completed project will look like.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMWcwEGijCS5c8CwX3nSev8g2uSVvNPivBoRC_S_J/s1237/Intersection9903.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="742" data-original-width="1237" height="384" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMWcwEGijCS5c8CwX3nSev8g2uSVvNPivBoRC_S_J/w640-h384/Intersection9903.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjl9lBECjgAmwFKuFYQJoaCM8NjU8f3LjlbdT7yuB8/s1270/sketch9903.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="791" data-original-width="1270" height="398" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjl9lBECjgAmwFKuFYQJoaCM8NjU8f3LjlbdT7yuB8/w640-h398/sketch9903.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>As part of the project, utilities will be replaced beneath the streets.

A requirement is that a percentage of old bricks (I think it is at least 50%) be reused.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rensselaer Plan Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Advisory Planning Commission met Thursday afternoon with two items of new business. The first was several zoning changes in the Sunnyside Addition (which is on the northeast side of Rensselaer). They are shown on the map below. Part of one block was changed from I-1 (light industrial) to R1 (residential) because that part of the block consists of residences. The block on which The State Highway Department formerly had buildings and part of another block were changed from R1 to I-1. The reason for the change was again to make the zoning consistent with the way the land is being used. The former State Highway lot has chemical pollution and can not be used for residences. There is currently a warehouse on the lot and another is planned.</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhB8jjrA6eyMC2hCqwh5NQpQna6e9UqtL0lYTjttqD/s1280/ZONING1.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhB8jjrA6eyMC2hCqwh5NQpQna6e9UqtL0lYTjttqD/w640-h480/ZONING1.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>The second item was a change of zoning for what used to be a gas station on the Corner of McKinley and Cherry (a bit north of St. Augustine School). The reason the owner wanted the change was that he wants to sell the property and it will be easier to sell with Business zoning. The lot is small and nothing bigger than the existing building can be placed on the lot. Both of the rezones were approved and now need City Council approval to be final.&#8232;</p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlWR_2hMLMaesmDwur_HAMX1E8AoOhXnEVGg04pjm/s1280/ZONING2.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="974" data-original-width="1280" height="488" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlWR_2hMLMaesmDwur_HAMX1E8AoOhXnEVGg04pjm/w640-h488/ZONING2.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p></p><p>The next meeting will be on March 21 at 5:30. On the agenda will be a proposal to rezone the Pizza King lot. The business has a variance to have a business in an area zoned residential, but changing the zoning to match what is actually there eliminates the need for the variance.</p><p><b>&#8232;Rensselaer BZA</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Board of Zoning Appeals meeting was scheduled for an hour after the Plan Commission meeting, and because the Plan Commission meeting lasted half an hour, there was some waiting for it to start. It had only one item on the agenda, a variance for height for a proposed outbuilding and house that will be built on Bunkum Road immediately to the east of the Iroquois Valley Church. (This lot is outside the City limits but in its exclusion zone, so it needs to meet City regulations, not County regulations.) The lot is a wooded lot and the buildings will be set back from the road so will be screened by trees. The current limit on height is 18 feet for outbuildings and 25 for houses. The petitioners want a garage 23 feet tall so it will be able to hold an RV. They were unsure if the house they will build will exceed 25 feet but it may; the plans are not finalized. The variance was granted with the condition that the garage not exceed 25 feet and the house not exceed 30 feet.</p><p>&#8232;Someone asked about the status of the old R&amp;M property. Plans for remodeling or rebuilding are being developed by Hamstra and will need State approval before work begins.</p><p>There was discussion of whether the current height limits are realistic, especially for houses in the exclusion zone on lots zoned suburban residential (which must be at least an acre in size.) The Board passed a recommendation to the Plan Commission to review the current height limits.</p><p>The next meeting will be on March 21 at 5:30. On the agenda will be a proposal for a conditional use variance for the Good Samaritan Food Pantry, which is moving from its current location on Van Rensselaer and Harrison to the building behind Pizza King.</p><p><b>&#8232;County Council</b></p><p>The Jasper County Council met on Tuesday evening and because the agenda did not look very interesting, I decided to attend via Zoom. Unfortunately, the audio quality was poor because some of the mics either were not turned on or the speakers were not speaking into them. If the person writing the minutes uses the recording to determine what was said, she will have a challenge.</p><p>The Council approved four sets of additional appropriations: for probation secretary and extradition, for road repair (allowing the highway department to spend up to $1 million on chip and seal and road materials), a donation of $75,000 to the Rensselaer Fire Department fire tower (discussed at the last meeting), and about $30,000 to complete repairs at Community Corrections. They then approved a batch of transfers, an amendment to the salary ordinance that dealt mostly with part-time employees, and finally the salary ordinance itself.</p><p>There was a discussion of public defenders that I had a hard time following because of poor audio. The County Courts are having a hard time attracting public defenders and may in the future create a public defender department. Compensation is an issue. The budget has funds for seven defenders but there are only six, so the action the Council took was to split the 7th contract among the six active defenders.</p><p>The last action of the Council was to fill their slot on the Justice Reinvestment Advisory Council (JRAC). It is a nine member board with the members determined by various offices. The council appoints one member, and last year it was Eric Kidwell, who said that he had a hard time making the meetings because of work conflicts. Nevertheless, he was reappointed with the hopes that the meetings will be Zoomed so he can attend remotely.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>We have had a mild winter this year except for a week in mid January when the temperatures never got above freezing and we had some extremely cold temperatures. At the end of last week we got a reminder that winter is still with us with a couple of inches of snow on Friday and temperatures mostly in the teens on Saturday. You can see the snow on the ground in the picture below of the new fencing around the natural gas regulator station next to McDonalds. The new gas regulators went on-line at the <a href="../../2023/10/a-tale-of-four-meetings.html" target="_blank">beginning of October</a>.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilK0TTPWTfjix0mOVZPUM5PN9bNwZj4xq1SasCvTi/s1280/Fencing0370.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="615" data-original-width="1280" height="308" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilK0TTPWTfjix0mOVZPUM5PN9bNwZj4xq1SasCvTi/w640-h308/Fencing0370.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>I missed the meeting at the Fairgrounds that discussed what should be in a new solar ordinance because I attended the Rensselaer BZA and Plan Commission meetings that were held at the same time as the solar meeting. I have not heard anything about what went on at the solar meeting.</p><p>I learned a bit more about the phosphorus building pictured in the last post. It does not take phosphorus out of the sewage. Rather it stores chemicals that are added to the sewage and that bind to the phosphorus in the water, helping neutralize it. The <a href="../../../www.in.gov/idem/files/nrpd_water-019.pdf" target="_blank">State</a> has mandated that Rensselaer (and other communities) add phosphorus control to their sewage plants.</p><p>In t<a href="../../2024/02/lent-starts-on-valentines-day.html" target="_blank">he previous post</a> I mentioned that the Tourism Commission gave money to Remington Main Street for a mural to be painted this summer. Below is the wall that it will cover. There is a lot of wall and it will be noticed. (The light was all wrong for this picture, but it was the best I could do.)</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRr256VCcen3hzfC1H7Fbf5ZDB_FuQWycXXTv52iW/s1280/RemingtonBuilding9877.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="598" data-original-width="1280" height="300" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRr256VCcen3hzfC1H7Fbf5ZDB_FuQWycXXTv52iW/w640-h300/RemingtonBuilding9877.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Top Link building has a new tenant, 181 Properties.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaFeLRKbx71prVx5N9Xi7O872dDkJ6dR_HMwZyFCo/s1280/newTenanats0368.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1023" data-original-width="1280" height="512" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaFeLRKbx71prVx5N9Xi7O872dDkJ6dR_HMwZyFCo/w640-h512/newTenanats0368.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The building that previously had Walter's Electric is being remodeled.

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
