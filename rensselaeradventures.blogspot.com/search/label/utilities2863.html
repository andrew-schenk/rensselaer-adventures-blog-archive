<p><b>&nbsp;BPW</b></p><p>The Board of Public Works met on Monday to approve paying construction bills. First up were Thieneman pay request #19 and #20 for $239,563.40 and $49,374.11 for work on the phosphorus building, which is a new addition to the sewage plant.</p><p>(Below is a picture of the phosphorus building.

One was for $47,700 from Commonwealth Engineering to pay for their work for on-site representative, and the other two, for $360,559 and $38,000 were from Maguire Iron, payments for constructing the water tower. The tower is up and the welding done, but it still needs to be painted.&nbsp; A change order for Maguire Iron involved a deduction of $79,300 and increases of $66,000 and $110,700 that will add work on existing water towers and the water treatment plant.</p><p>A claim of $38,125 was approved from a local builder for work on the phosphorus. The building is now finished. Fire Chief Haun received approval for a wellness insurance policy that provides protection against some of the chemical hazards that firefighters may encounter. The cost of $8611 will be split between the City and Marion Township. Finally the Board approved an amendment to a grant proposal that the City is submitting for more lead-line replacement. The amendment should make the proposal score better.</p><p><b>City Council meeting</b></p><p>After the usual preliminaries, the City Council ratified the appointment of Mayor Phillips to the IMPA board. Police officer Walker was given a letter of commendation for talking down a potential suicide from the I-65 overpass.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8232;The Council passed an EDA RPR Task Order that will pay up to $110 for inspection to Commonwealth Engineering during the Brick Street Project. The money will come from the water utility, which will be reimbursed at the end of the project if there are project funds remaining. Five inquiries were sent out and two replied, with Commonwealth deemed the best candidate.</p><p>&#8232;The Council approved purchase of a shoring box (used to keep the walls of a ditch from falling in on workers) for $15,543. Two quotes were obtained and the cost will be split between the water and gas utilities. The Council approved an amendment to the salary ordinance. There was a question if this requires two votes, and the City Attorney will investigate. If it does, the second vote will be at the next meeting.. A small transfer of funds was approved as were three requests for burial rights. The Council accepted conflict of interest statements from Kevin Armold and Jeff Rayburn.</p><p>&#8232;The gas tracker for February will reflect a 6&#162; increase per hundred cubic feet.&nbsp; A proposal from Commonwealth Engineering to submit a grant on behalf of the City for additional lead-line removal was approved.</p><p>The City''s concerns about a Front-Street property were addressed in a Court hearing on January 12.&nbsp; The Court issued an order specifying what had to be done with dates. In Administrative Comments the Mayor announced that a committee had been set up to see if the old light plant could be used as a Park Department office. Ceremonial groundbreaking for the Brick Streets project will be on Tuesday, February 20 at 9:00 am. The contractor is ready to get started removing bricks and Van Rensselaer in front of City Hall will be closed starting February 26.&nbsp; The Council made appointments, apparently with a telephone vote because the second January meeting was canceled, on members of the Plan Commission, Park Board, and Redevelopment Commission.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFjhINEFCPhesPFt4tgHJWZPpSfWpcsMei5yOBg0VZFy5jNQmBIA-2IXzI6yjI807ptXArP9ot3tBwpZKLicZA-hJ96GlUs6t6m-PSS5RXcpAyeiSGdiZBPMZ1I4LQFXXHYOwsKzjWa5eLckgx0ALTjIRztIBWuMWf5vXR4F63RdxOUZ6wOJCPeh2ZvGg/s1280/RoadClosed0366.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="714" data-original-width="1280" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFjhINEFCPhesPFt4tgHJWZPpSfWpcsMei5yOBg0VZFy5jNQmBIA-2IXzI6yjI807ptXArP9ot3tBwpZKLicZA-hJ96GlUs6t6m-PSS5RXcpAyeiSGdiZBPMZ1I4LQFXXHYOwsKzjWa5eLckgx0ALTjIRztIBWuMWf5vXR4F63RdxOUZ6wOJCPeh2ZvGg/w640-h358/RoadClosed0366.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Police Chief announced that a candidate had been selected to fill the police department opening. Chrissy Martin is the new secretary in the Building Department. The foundation for the Fire Department training tower will be poured on March 2, weather permitting. The tower itself should be erected in about two weeks. The Fire Department is currently without its rescue truck; it needs repairs.</p><p>Cleanup week will be May 6-10 and the Townwide Garage sale will be May 4.</p><p><b>&#8232;Tourism Commission</b></p><p>The Jasper County Tourism Commission met Tuesday morning with two new members. The Commission agreed to be a sponsor for $5000 for the Jasper County Fair, which will be celebrating its centennial this year. Last year there were approximately 159,000 visits by 49,000 people according to a company that gets its data from the tracking on smartphones.</p><p>Ball State has completed a draft of a strategic plan and there will be another meeting in March. The Tourism Office is working with Cameron Moberg planning a marketing piece. Yodel has officially launched in Jasper County.</p><p>There were two funding requests. The first was from Main Street Remington asking for $20,000 for a large mural on the Ziolkowski building on 2 S Ohio Street. The total cost is $45,000 and the Town of Remington has pledged $10,000. The request was approved.</p><p>The other request was from the <a href="https://demotteconnection.com/" target="_blank">Connection Center</a> in DeMotte that is completing a 28,000 square-foot domed facility that will be able to host a variety of sports and recreational activities. This is phase II for the Center that already has a health and wellness building that hosted 63 distinct events in 2023. There is no date set yet when this rec center will open.</p><p>The Connection Center Rec Center is owned by the Calvary Assembly of God Church and leased to a separate organization, the Connection Center. The Rec Center cost about $2 million but would have cost double that if not for the volunteer work used in building it. The Connection Center as a 99-year lease and will pay lease payments to the Assembly of God Church until the building loan is paid and then the lease payments stop. The revenue to support the Rec Center will come from a variety of different types of membership, sports camps, rental, and tournaments. The Center is closed on Sunday, partly because it shares parking with the Church, and one of the Commission members pointed out that closing on Sunday would make attracting tournaments difficult because most tournaments like a Saturday-Sunday schedule.</p><p>Overall the Commission members liked the idea of the Rec Center. There was no dollar amount requested, but the amount that is granted may be large enough so it would require the County Council to release money from the Tourism Commission Reserve Fund.&nbsp; The discussion lasted about an hour, perhaps the longest discussion ever by the Tourism Commission. No action was taken at this meeting. The members would like more information about estimates of how much use will be by people from outside the County (tourists) and how much use will be by local residents, and that estimate may determine how much the Commission is willing to grant.</p><p>The meeting lasted an hour and a half.</p><p><b>&#8232;Airport Authority Board</b></p><p>&#8232;The Airport Authority Board met Tuesday evening. A few years ago there was a <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2021/06/miscellany-june-12-2021.html" target="_blank">proposal to put a 4-H shooting range north west of the Airport</a> and the Airport Authority opposed it. The next suggested location for this shooting range was east of the Jail and for some reason that suggestion died. The new location is on the Fairgrounds and the Board was asked if the Airport might be OK with it. The range would be designed so the shooting would be toward the west. The Board passed a motion saying that the Airport had no objection to this location.</p><p>Most of the meeting was concerned with the details of running an airport. Fuel sales for January were very low, not just locally but throughout Indiana as the weather kept planes grounded. The Airport will again offer two internships this summer, one for a college student and one for a high school student. There are some people interested in building their own hangars at the Airport and there was a long discussion of what a lease for such a building should contain, (The lease is for the land.) After many ideas were tossed around, the members came to an agreement and passed a motion to approve those terms.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>Temperatures were unseasonably warm last Thursday and Friday. I took advantage of a warm day to take some pictures of the new water tower.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsuPluer3wEWfnME-LJf0QUf_qCdf2nXfhaDaX04_vdSjan1cgYclHpenrj1k-NMQ0Z649wkeUBYhiORsmajrEh59uDtTQ6YM2BE8GjlaIR-sP0c5IiqzHWkDJ657ejTEGMo5ikfsl5ptPo4ftC9RdjqTCE78kzryOn5Vq-1yAdDeYraKe6m-5423jC5U/s1280/Watertank0356.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="694" data-original-width="1280" height="348" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsuPluer3wEWfnME-LJf0QUf_qCdf2nXfhaDaX04_vdSjan1cgYclHpenrj1k-NMQ0Z649wkeUBYhiORsmajrEh59uDtTQ6YM2BE8GjlaIR-sP0c5IiqzHWkDJ657ejTEGMo5ikfsl5ptPo4ftC9RdjqTCE78kzryOn5Vq-1yAdDeYraKe6m-5423jC5U/w640-h348/Watertank0356.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>From a different vantage point:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4a-mqjav4LKl1rrk-oCj0ee8-BUBaDGUm_lZR3WDu6_chk-X2LdLY78GGxU4E7tDPk0ASWwf_M0d9i3XL2bUASF6V2_wy58xV4mO26CqvGRmLWjaIq9BBQ0h-C_-5isfpj0j1Jc5YCZlPXZkLqPUm-28yQeAiq5DW3Y8gjDcqKjUK3sOq5hv0fri9WV0/s1280/watertank9858.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="812" data-original-width="1280" height="406" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4a-mqjav4LKl1rrk-oCj0ee8-BUBaDGUm_lZR3WDu6_chk-X2LdLY78GGxU4E7tDPk0ASWwf_M0d9i3XL2bUASF6V2_wy58xV4mO26CqvGRmLWjaIq9BBQ0h-C_-5isfpj0j1Jc5YCZlPXZkLqPUm-28yQeAiq5DW3Y8gjDcqKjUK3sOq5hv0fri9WV0/w640-h406/watertank9858.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>I have heard robins but have not seem them yet.

There are a lot of contested races on the Republican side. There are two candidates for US Senate, Jim Banks and John Rust. The incumbent Senator, Mike Braun, is running for governor in a field of six. Congressman Jim Baird has four challengers. Judge Potter has a challenger. Jim Walstra is not running for reelection as Jasper County Commissioners and four people would like to replace him. Jeff DeYoung has three challengers. There are five candidates for Jasper County Council at large including three incumbents and I think the top three will be on the November ballot.</p><p>The Democratic ballot has fewer contested races.

<p><b>&nbsp;Board of Public Works</b></p><p>The Board of Public Works had four new faces on Monday evening. Mayor Phillips presided and Jeff Rayburn joined the Board. Rensselaer has a new City Attorney, Todd Sammons. Officer Daniel White attended representing the Police. I do not know if he will continue; Police Chief Matt Anderson was present at the City Council meeting that followed.</p><p>As usual, the meeting approved pay requests for City projects.&nbsp; It approved two totaling about $7750 for Commonwealth Engineering for work on the New Lift Station and Unsewered Areas Project. It approved $167,663 for Maguire Iron Partial Payment Request #7. Maguire continues assembling the pieces for the new water tower near the Interstate and erection of the tower is scheduled for January 18. There was a change order for the Water Main and Water Service Replacement project of $83,209.58 that will allow some additional service replacements. Citywide there are still several hundred lead service lines that should be replaced and the average cost of replacing them is about $15,000 each. Grimmer Plumbing is almost finished with its work and it had two payment requests approved, one for $128,896 and the other for $67,804. Commonwealth Engineering had a pay request for $34,107 approved.&nbsp;</p><p>The Board then had a discussion with a representative from Commonwealth about a City-County project to extend water and sewer to the west side of I-65. This will be done in two phases, the first getting the lines drilled under the Interstate and the second extending them to at least CR 1000W. I am not exactly sure what the Board approved. I think it gave the Mayor authority to sign a City-Council agreement that is being prepared by attorneys.&nbsp; When the project is completed, residents in the area will get lower&nbsp; fire insurance rates because of the closer hydrants, the City will get utility revenues, and the County will get increased tax revenue as the land is developed.</p><p>The phosphorus plant at the sewage plant is a couple of weeks away being operational. (I tried to get a picture of the building several weeks ago but my camera malfunctioned. The building is red.)</p><p><b>City Council meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer City Council began its meeting by electing Noel Weishaar president of the Council. (George Cover had for many years held that position.) The Mayor then swore in the City superintendents. Most were the 2023 superintendents, but there were two that were different. Brett Wilhite is the new electric superintendent and Bryce Black, who had been heading the Street and Water Departments for over a year as an assistant superintendent, was sworn in as the Street, Water, &amp; Sanitation Superintendent.</p><p>Below is a picture of the Council before the meeting began. From left to right are Councilmen Rayburn, Watson, Police Chief Anderson, Clerk-Treasurer Keys, Mayor Phillips, Councilmen Overton, Armold, and Weishaar.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJQKKibiKcBUBFiy55Cd8L5nnJqOS9EMKXt_P4tHTVnREjjbontdT2ROA6rXfnFt7kUGTdxN0dLN7FGIGEu3LdoWI2jEcj7XsZKstTWuW4Dp9ow4IU900U7mompnTVdRwHsvu6DR68eIfYmwk3jYxPPsTgX_tdVSqrL7D1_YzfbAkVao7DYo3rogAvcJs/s1280/NewCityCouncil9822.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="723" data-original-width="1280" height="362" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJQKKibiKcBUBFiy55Cd8L5nnJqOS9EMKXt_P4tHTVnREjjbontdT2ROA6rXfnFt7kUGTdxN0dLN7FGIGEu3LdoWI2jEcj7XsZKstTWuW4Dp9ow4IU900U7mompnTVdRwHsvu6DR68eIfYmwk3jYxPPsTgX_tdVSqrL7D1_YzfbAkVao7DYo3rogAvcJs/w640-h362/NewCityCouncil9822.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>(When I started attending the City Council meetings the people seated at the Council table consisted of G. Cover, E. Watson, F Bretzinger, S. Wood, R. Odle, W. Hollerman, and S Barton.)</p><p>The Council quickly approved <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2023/12/some-rezoning.html" target="_blank">three items from the Rensselaer Plan Commission</a>: a rezone of some SJC property from RS to R1, a rezone of the Busy Bee lot from R1 to B1, and a revised zoning ordinance that the Council had sent back to the Plan Commission for modification. (In the City the Council has final say on zoning changes just as in the County the Commissioners have final say on zoning changes.) Mr Watson recused himself from the SJC zoning vote. The Council also quickly passed the January gas tracker that reflects a 5&#162; increase per hundred cubic feet of usage.</p><p>The rest of the meeting was routine. The Council approved a burial-rights request (sold a lot in Weston Cemetery), a PR request for an employee retirement, and a FMLA request. Several people have been working on utility budgets. There is a Court hearing scheduled for Friday about a Front Street property that has concerned the Council. The Building Inspector wants a committee to develop an ordinance about parking in alleys and on sidewalks. The Police Department is going through the steps needed to hire a new officer. The Street Department has a couple of positions open. It was given permission to purchase safety equipment for working in holes. The Electric Department is taking down Christmas decorations and will be working to get electricity to to shelter in Foundation Park.</p><p>I missed the City Council meeting on December 26. The minutes are <a href="https://www.cityofrensselaerin.com/egov/documents/1703884725_56792.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>On Tuesday evening I had a choice between the Airport Authority Commission meeting or the Park Board meeting; both met at the same time. I chose the Park Board meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>New to the Park Board was Jeff Rayburn representing the City Council. Three members of the Park Corporation, Jannelle Musch, Stace Pickering, and Jenny Boget, were reappointed.&nbsp; Officers from 2023 were retained.</p><p>There was discussion of getting ready for tournaments at Blacker Fields. There will be some girls softball tournaments and they will only take place on Sundays and Saturdays. Attending the meeting was Mayor Phillips who discussed some of the possibilities he is pursuing. He is looking for uses of the old light plant and thought that it might have possibilities for Park usage. He would like to get more trails but needs some grants for that. He is working on getting electricity and lights to Foundation Park. He would like to convince SJC to do something to make their unused indoor athletic facilities available to the public. The minutes from the November meeting, which I missed, are available <a href="https://www.cityofrensselaerin.com/egov/documents/1704375455_58453.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The next meeting is scheduled for February 5.</p><p><b>Chamber lunch</b></p><p>The featured speaker at the January Chamber of Commerce lunch was JCEDO executive director <a href="https://www.jaspercountyin.com/about/leadership/" target="_blank">Sara DeYoung</a>. She talked about what JCEDO does and about economic development. She said that before she became director of JCEDO, she traveled through the small towns of the area and noted that some small towns were thriving and others seemed to be declining and wondered why. She has tried to learn from towns that are successful.</p><p>An initiative from her office is Yodel, a calendar application and website that she hopes will aid tourism and help County residents be more aware of what is happening in the County. Jasper County tourism has a new website at <a href="http://discoverjaspercounty.com/">discoverjaspercounty.com</a>.</p><p>Projects that JECDO is supporting or has recently supported include those of White Castle, FBI, Wheatfield Elevator, the DeMotte water expansion, Remington site expansion, a multicounty ag strategy, and child care. Community development and quality of life are now seen as important in economic development, something not true a few decades ago. There are no silver bullets and everyone should do what they can to improve quality of life.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>We did not have snow on Christmas day, but we did get snow on January 6, the traditional day of Epiphany, which for some marks the end of the Christmas season.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsxyvY_b80HZ1VC5ejIyB-k1wnmJEVYKrlzZlAEV6LnFZLG9RN64C-fP391IGJhSJ5CtgTLqvUTPyo-s86EjhfQY7nhV05TLHVzqhUpWFe1NA8tbD0pBGdjp6NdUUS0Pg-4RZWRfUn0mxOVCk9yVStnrQrUPg5uswhEsYgRn5iuTCBQWy5bb8SoQt40dk/s1280/snowOnEpiphany9821.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="799" data-original-width="1280" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsxyvY_b80HZ1VC5ejIyB-k1wnmJEVYKrlzZlAEV6LnFZLG9RN64C-fP391IGJhSJ5CtgTLqvUTPyo-s86EjhfQY7nhV05TLHVzqhUpWFe1NA8tbD0pBGdjp6NdUUS0Pg-4RZWRfUn0mxOVCk9yVStnrQrUPg5uswhEsYgRn5iuTCBQWy5bb8SoQt40dk/w640-h400/snowOnEpiphany9821.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>Since the 6th we have had repeated rounds of snow and melting.

Here, for example, is a graph for the end of December into January. Natural gas is the largest source of electricity and because many plants using gas can be turned on or off easily, it picks up the supply when needed. Nuclear cannot be switched on or off quickly, so it is a flat line.

It approved a change to the Responsible Building Ordinance that was not explained but it has something to do with apprentices. Several transfers of funds were approved before the Council approved the electric tracker that raises electrical rates for the next quarter by $2.18 for 1000 kilowatt hours of usage. The Council approved a budget for the sewer department that must be submitted to USDA-Rural Development because that agency is funding improvements to the sewer utility. In administrative comments Mr Watson mentioned that the American Legion had served 759 Thanksgiving dinners. The work being done on the streets that have been torn up to replace lead service lines is to prepare the streets ready for patching.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>The last art exhibit of 2023 is now on display at the Fendig Gallery.

The store is open Thursday, Friday, and Saturday mornings and is selling odds and ends, much like a flea market. The new owners are remodeling the second floor to make it into a residence. It has not had people living there for many years. They specialize in remodeling homes and this is their first venture with a commercial property.

They delayed signing a road-use agreement, moving the item to a continued meeting on October 16. On Monday that continued meeting also had a standing-room-only audience, and it may have had more people attending than were at the initial meeting.</p><p>Before the road-use agreement was discussed, the Commissioners had several other items on their agenda. The County switched health insurance brokers this year and the new brokers had promised they could find savings for the County. The new brokers shopped the various policies and said they had found $672K in savings with no reduction in benefits. The Commissioners approved the changes.</p><p>Two bids for a new roof on the prosecutor's annex building were reviewed but no decision was made because there may be a third party who will make a bid. The Commissioners approved a change in the holiday schedule for the Highway Department. A jail correctional officer has resigned and the Sheriff was given approval to replace her.</p><p>Then it was time for the big item, the road-use-agreement. BP had agreed to end the testing on October 30 and will allow the County to hire an expert to review the data. There were a number of public comments. The first person wondered why the public had not been allowed to vote on this issue. Another person recognized that the County can do little to stop this project if the State gives it a green light and is organizing to change the legislation. The legislation that takes the permitting of this type of project away from the counties is <a href="https://legiscan.com/IN/text/HB1209/2022" target="_blank">House Bill 1209</a> that was passed in 2022. A person from Porter County who is running for Congress urged the County to look for opportunities to disrupt the process. It is federal tax credits that make this project viable; without federal support none of these sequestering projects would be profitable. A retired 3M person said that contaminates in the fluid that will be pumped into the ground might react chemically with the rocks and that no one knows what the long-term risks of this project would be. In the end the Commissioners signed the agreement even though I am pretty sure that they agree with the audience that the County does not want the County to be used for carbon dioxide sequestering.</p><p>They passed a resolution to gather information to be used for a future ordinance governing seismic testing on County roadways.</p><p><b>County Council meeting</b></p><p>The County Council met Tuesday evening in a long meeting, lasting about two hours. Rensselaer Fire Chief Kenny Haun told them about the addition to the Rensselaer training center that will be built with State funding and is expected to be finished in the Spring of 2024. However, the Department needs to provide some infrastructure and Haun would like to have the County contribute for this. No action was taken and the request for funds will be discussed at the joint Council-Commissioners meeting in November.</p><p>The Council approved an ordinance that allows the Drainage Board to secure a line of credit to help finance the cleaning of the R. E. Davis ditch. It also approved an ordinance that allows money from the Recorder's Perpetuation fund to be used for supplies and salaries. This ordinance was recommended by the State Board of Accounts and does not represent a change in what the County has been doing.</p><p>Next was a long discussion about a resolution establishing an Economic Revitalization Area in Walker Township that will allow a tax abatement for a proposed solar park. This project has been mentioned at various County meetings over the <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2021/08/planning-and-development.html" target="_blank">past few years</a>. It will use 470 acres and have a 60 megawatt capacity. The abatement will be decided next month. Offsetting the abatement will be an economic development payment that the company will make. Unlike the tax revenue that is divided into various funds, this money can be spent in whatever way the County wants. After reading the resolution, a vote was taken and it was approved by a 3 to 2 vote. However, one of the Council members was attending via Zoom and his delayed vote as a no, so the vote was tied 3 to 3. Council president Jordan then broke the tie and the final vote was 4 to 3. I am not sure if the negative votes were cast because the members do not like abatements or if it was a protest against solar power. (Voting for were Jordan, Fritts, Norwine, and Risner. Voting against were Armold, Kidwell, and Moore.)</p><p>The Council then approved a number of transfers of funds, none very large, and moved on to additional appropriations. Most were for the Sheriff's Department. All of the additions were approved except one for Community Corrections, which was tabled because the Council wanted more information.</p><p>The Council President then read and the Council approved five budgets, those of the County, the Rensselaer Central School Corporation, the Airport Authority, the Northwest Indiana Solid Waste District, and the Iroquois Conservancy. Discussion of these budgets had been held at the previous meeting. The budget of the Northwest Indiana Solid Waste District is approved by Jasper County because Jasper County has the largest assessed valuation of any of the counties that the District serves.</p><p>The Prosecutor had some salary adjustments that should be made and they will be taken up in January. For reasons that I did not understand, Walker Township could not approve its budget with the normal process and the Council finished the meeting by approving its budget.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>There was a partial solar eclipse on Saturday. It was unnoticeable here because of the heavy clouds, but some people in the west got to observe it as an annular eclipse. However, next year there will be a total eclipse that will be visible in Indianapolis. It will be in April, a month that has a lot of cloudy days.

<p><b>Gas Utility work</b></p><p>The Gas Department continues work replacing the regulator next to McDonalds on South College. The old regulator has been dismantled and some temporary lines are feeding gas into the distribution network. At the regulator station the gas pressure for residences is lowered from 100 psi to 30 psi. Some gas continues at 100 psi and goes on to the regulator station on Lincoln Avenue. The 100-psi line at one time also fed the power plant.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcX682Q17jjX1GitrJm7-trU8gepAKlrlVhaGoGmcrIGC6WFaRbuQnLKZ8rTTLna0yGdb9K_BT_MVzd8HjAiIQvlTSbFXYRb8PWd3pWTqWRUiBw42666yF90_Xab1JjVJraoPteh24GLX-_qhOfWNuPPCk9J3PXG165641isBZoxi5CwGYw9TnNsA1kDw/s1280/gasworksIMG_9060.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcX682Q17jjX1GitrJm7-trU8gepAKlrlVhaGoGmcrIGC6WFaRbuQnLKZ8rTTLna0yGdb9K_BT_MVzd8HjAiIQvlTSbFXYRb8PWd3pWTqWRUiBw42666yF90_Xab1JjVJraoPteh24GLX-_qhOfWNuPPCk9J3PXG165641isBZoxi5CwGYw9TnNsA1kDw/w640-h480/gasworksIMG_9060.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The old regulator is gone but there is still equipment lowering the pressure.&nbsp;<p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnDAKbtw7a1disPhZ5o0EeCWUFLTZ-ejIpklPQetGkdXj1-kwerWNvYCcngKSosMQkwi_0QHqpexPW4W7FbdYVxYT6jBYiUjuZYro6E-fTFbBFnHhyjDNIFE0WPvy7NZNSsxCQGGPElarMYYfPYKNjI5YL9_-wXk10mUuoDG3BySkDbUBnx1mxlx5VLfk/s1280/regularorsIMG_9059.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnDAKbtw7a1disPhZ5o0EeCWUFLTZ-ejIpklPQetGkdXj1-kwerWNvYCcngKSosMQkwi_0QHqpexPW4W7FbdYVxYT6jBYiUjuZYro6E-fTFbBFnHhyjDNIFE0WPvy7NZNSsxCQGGPElarMYYfPYKNjI5YL9_-wXk10mUuoDG3BySkDbUBnx1mxlx5VLfk/w640-h480/regularorsIMG_9059.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>I find it amazing that they can do this kind of work without interrupting the gas supply.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><b>A mystery</b></p><p></p><p>I talked briefly last week to a woman who probably knows more about local cemeteries than anyone else. I asked her for the name of the Indian boy who died at the Indian School and is buried in Mount Calvary Cemetery. His name was Frank Hendricks and I found a notice of his death by searching the Hoosier State Chronicles. I attached the <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/83138611/frank-j-hendricks" target="_blank">notice to his findagrave memorial</a>.</p><p>Doing a bit more digging, I found two other death notices of pupils at the Indian School who the paper reported were buried at Mount Calvary. However, they are not recorded in the records that I have access to. The first is from the <i>Rensselaer Republican</i> of April 26, 1894 and the second from the same paper of October 11, 1894.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgW--38hSfXwBNT_do5wi_mDVab0IY716whva09EyNQpoP51BDFOZefrJs4hVDFTDqZvbylmKhSG9P_HmuoMuP6CpUEu-ZPvP30thl_K1VkqOuVUrGyS1LK8kKGMFLYWHk8RrDmPUgy91hyjMjIL9Nc09GWz-3jI8p4DS-XuV7jLCOiZw2_gh9z9ZJiOg/s657/April26_1894.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="355" data-original-width="657" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgW--38hSfXwBNT_do5wi_mDVab0IY716whva09EyNQpoP51BDFOZefrJs4hVDFTDqZvbylmKhSG9P_HmuoMuP6CpUEu-ZPvP30thl_K1VkqOuVUrGyS1LK8kKGMFLYWHk8RrDmPUgy91hyjMjIL9Nc09GWz-3jI8p4DS-XuV7jLCOiZw2_gh9z9ZJiOg/s16000/April26_1894.png" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_m6knFRXCN4MW0cMXRjeImGOIIwd4uBjPkbAsuLOXXUl9n2c1BYCpC_LEBHYvh9D1B9kLoq3kzH1UnN75DkgWiixdahixpMFAbusrYMSzdu4ErafRkgCJ2DEUfEgqrOZ7JW1yigDoSI2yeODbBzB6UdyJlx7atXHapZ0lVNZFQVqh39g7zRl7mwAR0NM/s654/Oct11_1894_p5.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="459" data-original-width="654" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_m6knFRXCN4MW0cMXRjeImGOIIwd4uBjPkbAsuLOXXUl9n2c1BYCpC_LEBHYvh9D1B9kLoq3kzH1UnN75DkgWiixdahixpMFAbusrYMSzdu4ErafRkgCJ2DEUfEgqrOZ7JW1yigDoSI2yeODbBzB6UdyJlx7atXHapZ0lVNZFQVqh39g7zRl7mwAR0NM/s16000/Oct11_1894_p5.png" /></a></div><p>There seem to be three possibilities.

I am not sure where the third one is, but I will find it.<p><b>Jasper County BZA and Plan Commission meetings</b></p><p>On Monday evening the Jasper County BZA met in the Circuit Court room. The Commissioners room was, in the words of one person there, full of junk. The County is having the floor on the second floor smoothed and polished, and the various things that were there were moved into the Commissioners room.&nbsp;</p><p>The BZA had only one item on its agenda, a request for a variance for a lot width on a parcel in Keener Township. The required frontage is 250 feet but the owner wanted to split the lot, with a 50 foot access road to the back half. He had no plans to build but wanted that option for the future. There were several people in the audience who spoke on the matter, some for and some against. Concerns were that the road already had too much traffic and adding another driveway would only increase it, potential for groundwater contamination and effects on wildlife. The variance was granted with one member of the BZA opposed.</p><p>After a short break, the Plan Commission met. The first item on the agenda was a matter <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2023/08/its-hot.html" target="_blank">continued from the August meeting</a> in which the applicant had requested a two-lot subdivision. The Commission had continued the matter because the applicant had built without a building permit even though he knew he needed it. The Commission had imposed a $2500 fine and mandated that the owner hire an inspector to make sure the building was up to code. At this meeting the Planning officer reported that all the conditions had been met and the two-lot subdivision was approved.</p><p>There were two more two-lot subdivisions approved. The first was in Walker Township where two two-acre lots were being carved from a larger plot, and the second was for the person who had requested the lot-width variance in the BZA meeting. The last item was a rezone of some land in Jordan Township from A1 to A2, The land is a flood plain and not buildable. The owner wants to use it for hunting, which apparently is not an approved use for land zoned A1.</p><p><b>Jasper County Council</b></p><p>The Jasper County Council meeting on Tuesday was long but not especially interesting. The Sheriff had made a job offer to a person who decided not to accept the day before he was to begin. The Sheriff has found another person for the position, but wanted input from the Council about starting pay because the new person has several years of experience in law enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>The Council approved several additional appropriations. One was for Community Corrections Renovations and was listed on the agenda for $500,000.00. The Council decided that an extra zero had been added and approved it for $50,000.&nbsp;</p><p>The Budget was then read and approved on first reading. There will need to be an approval for a second reading before it is adopted. If you would like to see the budget, you can find it at the<a href="https://gateway.ifionline.org/report_builder/Default3a.aspx?rpttype=budget&amp;rpt=DetailedExpenditures&amp;rptName=Line-Item%20Budget%20Estimate" target="_blank"> Indiana gateway here</a>.</p><p>Next on the agenda was a review of non-binding reviews. No reviews were done. Rather the message to whatever units of government that are included here was to stay within the state growth factor.</p><p>There were four reviews of binding taxing units: Rensselaer Central School Corporation, Airport Authority, Northwest Indiana Solid Waste, and Iroquois Conservancy. There were presentations for each and the approval of the budgets will be voted in the October meeting. The Airport Authority budget is slightly lower this year and it was a busy year for crop dusters. The solid waste district has a slight increase in its budget, but it has no taxes. Its revenues come from the tipping fees at the landfills.</p><p>The most interesting part of the meeting came at the end when the two commissioners who were attending the meeting were asked for comments. They are working with the City of Rensselaer to attempt to get City utilities west of the Interstate. The State controls the process for carbon capture, so the commissioners are telling people with concerns that they should share those concerns with their state legislators. The commissioners cannot stop the project, but it will need 70% of the landowners involved to agree.

<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
