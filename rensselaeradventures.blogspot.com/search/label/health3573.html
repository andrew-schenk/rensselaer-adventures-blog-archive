The September meeting is the meeting in which the Council reviews budgets for several taxing units and then approves them in the October meeting. First up was the Rensselaer Central School Corporation. The Council reviews this budget because the School Board is appointed, not elected.</p><p>Mr Craig, the superintendent of the School Corporation, read a budget summary and commented on parts of it. (Some of those numbers might be available on the Indiana Gateway site, <a href="https://budgetnotices.in.gov/unit_lookup.aspx?ct=37000" target="_blank">here</a>.) He noted that assessed valuation was up 12% and that should lead to a lower tax rate. The School Board had scheduled a vote on a new bond issue at its meeting later Tuesday night that would fund new doors and windows at the highs school, new light poles for the football field, gutters for Van Rensselaer, new bleachers for the middle school gym, and new auditorium lighting at the high school. In addition to tax revenues, the schools are funded by the State, which gives $8000 for each student enrolled. That money is used to pay teachers. He said that enrollment was up this year, but the trend for recent years is smaller enrollments. The peak number of students was in the 1970s. The rise in enrollments this year was in the grade and middle school. High school was down and he attributed that to kids choosing on-line schools. The school officials then left to get to the School Board meeting.</p><p>Next the Council considered the County budget. Again a bunch of numbers were read. Most County employees will be getting a $2500 pay increase for next year. A flat increase of this sort benefits lower-income employees more than higher-income employees. A new public defender system will change the 2025 budget. The Sheriff is changing the pay schedule of his employees to a percentage of his salary, which in turn is a percentage of the Prosecutor's salary. The vote on the budget will take place at the October meeting.</p><p>The Council next reviewed the Northwest Indiana Solid Waste District budget. This budget had not been approved by the District's Board because the last meeting did not have a quorum. To help it meet future quorums, the Council appointed Jason Armold to serve on the board. The District is completely funded by tipping fees at the landfills in Newton and White Counties. The Jasper County Council reviews the budget because Jasper County has the highest assessed valuation of the counties served by the district.</p><p>The Council then reviewed the budget of the Iroquois Conservancy, which clears log jams from the Iroquois River. This year the Conservancy has added those parts of Benton County that are in the watershed of the Iroquois River.</p><p>Before approving the August minutes of three sessions of the Council, the Council approved the budget of Walker Township. It could not approve its own budget because two of the Board members were firemen (and presumably had a conflict of interest).&nbsp; Other townships were instructed to stay within the 4% growth factor.</p><p>The Council then approved two transfers. At a previous meeting they had approved appropriation for the Recorders Perpetuation Fund but it had been put into the wrong fund. At this meeting they reduced the wrong fund and made an additional appropriation to the correct fund. They also approved spending from a donation fund for maintenance on sirens, an additional appropriation for law books and research for the Courts, and an appropriation for a cleaning lady for the Surveyor/Extension office.&nbsp;</p><p>Sara DeYoung from Jasper County Economics Development Organization gave a presentation about JCEDO that was similar to the presentation that she gave to the Commissioners the day before. She stressed that we need to create communities that people want to live in so that when opportunities come our way, we can take advantage of them.</p><p>The review of the Airport budget had been advertised for 7:00 so it did not take place with the other reviews. The Airport was established in 1933 but was closed during WWII. Fuel sales, a major source of Airport revenue, have been good this year. The Airport has averaged about 500 takeoffs and 500 landings per month. Last year the high-school class at the Airport, which has the goal of getting students ready to pursue aviation careers, finished with four students. This year the class has seven students, three from RCHS, three from KVHS, and one from SNHS. Priorities for the future are finishing the master plan and designing a new hangar building. There is a wait list for hangar space. When the Airport makes capital improvements, 90% of the cost is funded by the FAA.&nbsp;</p><p>The County has a local income tax (LIT) of 2.864% and the revenue is split to fund various categories. Currently the rate that goes to fund ambulance services is .02 and the Council would like to increase it but to do that without raising the overall tax rate, something else must be reduced. After some discussion, they decided to come back to the issue in October.</p><p>The County is under a burn ban because the dry weather has increased the changes of field fires. White and Pulaski have also announced burn bans. (Rensselaer got a couple of showers Friday, but the rain was very localized so the burn ban continues for the County.)</p><p>The Commissioners established a committee to plan for a new forensics center and one of the positions on that committee is assigned to a Council member. The Council appointed Jacob Misch.</p><p>At the Commissioners meeting there was a discussion of how to account for fees that the Coroner pays for transporting bodies. The Commissioners decided that was an issue for the Council. The Council and Auditor had a confusing discussion on the issue and I am not sure if agreement was reached. The Council did agree to raise the transfer fee from $125 to $175 retroactively to January 1.</p><p>The meeting lasted almost 2.5 hours and thankfully there were no public comments.</p><p><b>Networking event</b></p><p>On Thursday the Jasper Newton Foundation and <a href="https://unitedwaynwi.org/" target="_blank">United Way of Northwest Indiana</a> hosted a lunch and networking event at the Carnegie Center. This was one of several such events that the United Way has had in the region it serves, primarily Porter and Lake Counties but also Starke, Jasper, and Newton. After a quick lunch and some remarks from United Way (I regret not getting a tour of their mobile van that they brought), the people attending introduced themselves and told what they did. Here are the organizations that I caught and some highlights.</p><p>Level Up works with United Way to help people get certifications and jobs or better jobs. They provide conseling and teach financial skills. To get into their program, one needs to have the desire to improve.</p><p>Meals on Wheels delivers meals and as a byproduct also provides wellness checks. Like many of the organizations represented, they are headquartered in Lake or Porter Counties.</p><p>Girls on the Run of Northwest Indiana has a site in DeMotte and would like to see one established in Rensselaer.</p><p><a href="https://www.gotrofnwi.org/" target="_blank">Alzheimer's Association</a> sponsors walks in Porter and Lake Counties and would like to see one established in Newton or Jasper County.</p><p>WorkOne has a Rensselaer office and helps people get training to advance in the job market.</p><p>KIRPC Head Start is underenrolled in all of their locations except Rensselaer.</p><p>Newton County Community Services provides similar services to those provided by Jasper County Community Services. This past year they started a community garden.</p><p>Northshore Health Center has a location in DeMotte.</p><p><a href="https://neoadulted.org/" target="_blank">New Vistas High School</a> is an alternative charter school in Portage.&nbsp;</p><p>The Connection Center in DeMotte has been expanding their programs.</p><p>Catholic Charities-Diocese of Gary looks to partner with other organizations.</p><p>I did not catch the name of an adult education group that helped people get their GEDs.</p><p>The American Heart Association is putting blood-pressure hubs in various locations to help find people with very high blood pressure and who are unaware that they have a problem.</p><p>Scouting, which used to be Boy Scouts before they opened to girls, has several programs.</p><p>Birthright of Rensselaer supports pregnant women and women with young children.</p><p>Right Steps staffs eight child care centers including Appletree in Rensselaer.</p><p>Indiana Department of Health-Health Equity Council was represented as was Franciscan Health Hospice care.</p><p><a href="https://www.anewministries.org/" target="_blank">Anew Ministries</a> provides support for young, mostly teen mothers who face challenges. They have a chapter in DeMotte.</p><p>Finally, Saint Joseph's College announced that they had purchased two semis for the CDL Academy and that they would be restarting the <a href="../../2012/08/building-hoophouse.html" target="_blank">hoop house</a> with the Indiana Agriculture and Technology charter school, which now lists SJC as their regional home instead of the Jasper County Fairgrounds.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rensselaer Plan Commission</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Plan Commission met on Thursday evening. At a previous meeting they did not give approval to the SJC Building Trades subdivision because some details still needed to be worked out. Apparently they were not all worked out because Commission tabled the item to the October 17 meeting.</p><p>The next item also concerned SJC. There was no zoning for the SJC property. The proposal sent to the City Council with a favorable recommendation would make the campus between Sparling and the highway as well as the bowling alley, the field south of Justin Hall which SJC no longer owns, and Mount Calvary Cemetery zoned as B2, which is a business zoning. The College Woods will be zoned RS, which is the least restrictive residential zoning, if the Council concurs. Since the Council asked the Commission to deal with this issue, it is highly likely that they will concur.</p><p>A second matter that the Council wanted the Commission to address was the need to get variances when a residence in a zone classified for business changed hands. The original variance does not transfer. The Commission voted to change the policy to allow non-conforming residences in business zoning to continue being used as residences when there is a change in ownership. It also allows, with some restrictions, a non-conforming residence to be repaired if it is damaged.</p><p>The State says that redevelopment commissions should have a seal so the Commission adopted one. I did not see what it looked like.</p><p>Finally, on August 21 the members agreed via telephone to change the lot on which the SJC building trades program would build from lot 5 to lot 1. They affirmed this change with a vote. (I was wondering why the construction was happening on what I thought was the wrong lot.)</p><p><b>Odds and ends</b></p><p>There was a <a href="https://www.newsbug.info/rensselaer_republican/news/family-calls-for-investigation-of-jasper-county-man-s-death-after-police-call-for-seizure/article_db427826-75fa-11ef-99b0-1b9ec615fbee.html" target="_blank">death in the County</a> that has attracted media attention.

It had excellent and very colorful costumes, energetic choreography, and was well cast. On Friday night I thought the sound track was too loud as it drowned out some of the solo singers but I was told that the volume was lower on Saturday. (In the distant past, they had a pit band. It would be nice to bring it back.)</p><p>Before the performance there was an announcement that people should not take pictures, so I did not. However, I have several pictures taken on Wednesday at a preview at the Cup of Joy Cafe, Too. Pictured below are Thing 2, Thing 1, Sour Kangaroo, and Horton the Elephant. The story is a mishmash of 15 books by Dr. Seuss, with most of the plot involving Horton.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1nbuDVw3XDvNegWgmOC1w2WcZkoxZy1dC5RgtIhy/s1280/suesicalIMG_0474.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1nbuDVw3XDvNegWgmOC1w2WcZkoxZy1dC5RgtIhy/w640-h480/suesicalIMG_0474.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The Cat in the Hat had a major role and did an excellent job.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD9HolTMyrp6DPa5HNNo7yuSZexNJ4IJk0s9DU6Qv/s1280/catInHat0472.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="1163" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgD9HolTMyrp6DPa5HNNo7yuSZexNJ4IJk0s9DU6Qv/w582-h640/catInHat0472.jpg" width="582" /></a></div>Next year will be the 50th year for the Summer Theater. The first performance I saw was <i>The Hobbit</i>&nbsp;in 1978. It was, if I remember correctly, performed in the basement of St Augustine Church and they cut battle scenes because they seemed too violent. The first play one of my children was in was <i>Annie</i> in 1984. My kids were in crowd scenes or with only one or two lines, with one exception. A son played Winthrop in the <i>Music Man</i> (1992) and did an excellent job.<br /><p><b>Sidewalks</b></p><p>Almost all of the concrete work is finished for the Brick Street Project.

The Plan Commission had <a href="../../2024/02/spring-turbines-bricks.html" target="_blank">voted an unfavorable recommendation</a> for this item in its February meeting due to concerns about a variety of issues. and the Commissioners had not acted on the recommendation in <a href="../../2024/03/early-march-2024-meetings.html" target="_blank">their March meeting</a>, but had decided to work through the concerns of the Plan Commission. The Commissioners believed that those issues had been addressed so the item was back on the agenda. In particular, the Commissioners had found a construction compliance monitor that would report to the County but the cost of which would be borne by the contractor. The Commissioners had received about twenty letters supporting the district from people or groups, including the Town of Remington and the Tri-County Schools.</p><p>Because the meeting had attracted a substantial number of citizens, Mr. Bontreger let people voice their concerns before the Commissioners voted on the overlay district. He also said that in June the Commissioners would have a pilot program to allow citizens to submit comments and concerns via the Internet so that those who could not attend the meetings could have their voices heard.</p><p>One person gave the Commissioners the result of a survey he had conducted. The Commissioners asked how he found people to respond and he said many came from Facebook and others from door-to-door canvassing. There were questions about the CO2 pipeline. At the first meeting of the month someone suggested the County could do more to resist the proposed pipeline. The County is working on an ordinance but it is not clear yet what it can control. A county in Iowa passed a restrictive ordinance but it has been challenged in court and the case is on appeal. The County does not want to pass something that will result in high legal bills and be rejected by Courts. One person suggested that the County establish districts for solar and wind and was told that the wind ordinance does that for wind: they are only allowed in Carpenter Township and a mile strip of Jordan Township. After hearing the comments, the Commissioners approved the wind-farm overlay district.</p><p>Next on the agenda was an agreement between the County and the City of Rensselaer to extend water and sewer to the west side of I-65. This project should encourage development west of the Interstate and tax revenues from improvements would go to the County. The County has agreed to help fund this project with surplus ARPA money (the federal stimulus money). However, extending the sewer to Sherwood Forest and Kelley Green would require a sewage plant and this might be funded with a TIF district, something for the future. The Commissioners approved the agreement.</p><p>In other business the Commissioners approved purchase of a refrigerator, approved finishing the floors of the first floor of the Courthouse to match those on the second floor, and noted that there was a need for a notary public in the Courthouse for County business. Recently requirements for notaries have increased so there are fewer people becoming notaries. They also approved a gas card for the Coroner's van.</p><p>&nbsp;Then it was time for more public comments. One person gave an update on the Connection Center in DeMotte and the Commissioners recommended to the Council to appropriate $50,000 to help get the recreational part up and running. Somewhere in the comments someone at the table gave a list of payments that the various energy projects will provide the County and I think the total was $18.5 million. Much of that would come from the proposed Carpenter Township wind farm and includes rebuilding the roads used during construction.</p><p>One thing I noticed is that some of the people commenting want to solve national problems at the local level. For example, if a person thinks that federal energy policy with its subsidies for solar and wind and increasing regulations on fossil fuel is a bad energy policy, does it follow that one should oppose the County taking advantage of those subsidies as a way of opposing the federal policies? Or are local and federal two separable issues? Even if the federal policy is bad, should the local level take advantage of the dollars the policy makes available to local levels?</p><p>After the meeting adjourned, there was a short (five minute) meeting of the Regional Water and Sewer District, which is composed of the three Commissioners. This group has authority over providing water and sewer to all the unincorporated parts of Jasper County. They approved the County-City agreement to extend water and sewer west of I-65 and also transferred the authority to provide sewer and water to that area to Rensselaer.</p><p><b>Jasper County BZA and Plan Commission meetings</b></p><p>The Jasper County BZA and Plan Commission met Monday evening. There was one item on the agenda of the BZA and that item contained two parts, a request from Rose Acre Farms for a special exception for a confined feeding operation and requests for variances for setback from neighbors.&nbsp; In <a href="../../2024/03/a-lot-of-pictures.html" target="_blank">March Rose Acre</a> had&nbsp; appeared before the Plan Commission requesting their land be rezoned from A1 to A3 and that request had been granted. However, the code requires a special exception be granted for any confined feeding operation. Rose Acre is converting to cage-free flocks and needs to rebuild its buildings on the corner of SR 16 and US 231 to do that. It is replacing three buildings with two that are larger. The new buildings will hold a bit over 200,000 birds each while the previous barns held a total of somewhat over 500,000. The special exception was granted.</p><p>The code says that the buildings should be 1320 feet away from residential dwellings. There are three residences near the proposed buildings that are slightly less than that, with the closest at 1200 feet. There were no complaints from neighbors and the variance was granted. Rose Acres also wanted a variance from the requirement that a shelter belt of trees be planted around the buildings. Trees attract birds and those birds may carry disease that can destroy the flock of birds in a barn. This has happened to Rose Acres in one of their Iowa facilities. The Board also gave them a variance on the shelter-belt issue.</p><p>The Plan Commission met after the BZA adjourned. Their first item was a rezone from R1 to A1. The property is an 8.66 acre lot in Keener Township adjacent to Newton County. The property is currently used as a horse facility but two people who would like to buy it want it zoned properly so they can continue using it for agricultural purposes with the proper zoning. They want to operate animal educational programs involving farm animals and reptiles. Their request was sent on to the Commissioners with a favorable recommendation.</p><p>The second items were revisions to the solar ordinance, which were summarized in a <a href="../../2024/05/mostly-may-meetings.html" target="_blank">previous post.</a>&nbsp;The ordinance was read and then both members of the Commission and the public picked at it with a variety of questions and suggestions for changes. The most hostile comments were directed at the battery storage provisions and concerned safety in case of a fire. Eventually the Commission sent it to the Commissioners with no recommendation in hopes that the Commissioners will make changes and send back an improved revision to the Plan Commission. (The Plan Commission cannot amend what is presented to them as written amendments to ordinances, though they can amend proposed changes to the ordinance maps.) The revisions impose more cost on developers and it will be interesting to see if the additional costs will cause developers to abandon Jasper County for solar farms. Also, someone commented that the County would like any battery storage systems to be confined to the NIPSCO property east of Wheatfield.</p><p>The last item on the agenda was an amendment to the UDO that adds requirements for special-purpose (or test) wells. At present there is nothing in the UDO about test wells, wells drilled to examine the underlying geology and rock strata, so if a company obtains a permit from the State to drill, they do not even have to tell the County that they are drilling a well. The proposed amendment establishes a requirement to tell the County about any such well as well as provide setbacks and fencing requirements. There was general consensus that the proposed amendment needed changes but that something needed to be put in place immediately, so the Commission sent it to the Commissioners with a favorable recommendation and the hope that there would be further development of the ordinance.&nbsp;</p><p>The next meeting will be on June 24 if there is an agenda. The meeting adjourned at about 10:00, three hours after the BZA meeting started and shortly after the thunderstorms moved in.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEis35QFJ-15AgVD_LsGYG2qjIRegsPTnmnBTS0aLfX/s1280/sunset0593.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="612" data-original-width="1280" height="306" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEis35QFJ-15AgVD_LsGYG2qjIRegsPTnmnBTS0aLfX/w640-h306/sunset0593.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p><b>Jasper County Coucil meeting</b></p><p>The County Council met Tuesday evening for its May meeting with a list of additional appropriations on its agenda. It approved money for an administrative assistant/evidence based practice coordinator for Community Corrections and funds for Valley Oaks Health. Valley Oaks had not requested a payment last year that it should have so it was paid this year and the funds needed to be appropriated. Some funds that were supposed to be in the budget for the 100th year anniversary for the Fair were not, so they were appropriated. The Sheriff's Department is upgrading computer equipment and an appropriation was made for that.&nbsp;</p><p>After a confusing discussion of moving money from the EMS director to an administrative assistant, the transfer was approved. Then the Council was very happy to make a budget reduction of over $4 million in the Highway budget.</p><p>The Council changed its meeting time for future meetings from 7:00 Central to 6:00 Central. They reappointed a member of the Library Board. The State is releasing a large block of money that it had collected for and not previously returned to local governments and the County share is $2.4 million. The Coroner gave the Council plans for a new annex he would like to be built.

<p><b>&nbsp;Commissioners meeting</b></p><p>The November Commissioners meeting had an agenda of routine matters and was fairly short for a Commissioners meeting. As I arrived, I noticed that work had begun on expanding the parking lot of what I call the Sparling Annex and work on spreading stone and compacting it continued for most of the meeting.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXigKjvIvI0RW3zHunI5B3ObclQmJXojHXjkEsag7/s1280/ParkingIMG_9389.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXigKjvIvI0RW3zHunI5B3ObclQmJXojHXjkEsag7/w640-h480/ParkingIMG_9389.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p>There were buried cable permits approved for some simple bores, for work on a United Telephone project near Fair Oaks, and three bores for manure lines. The Commissioners decided to wait another month before accepting a bid for fixing the roof on the Prosecutor's annex. The <a href="../../../www.jaspercountyin.gov/egov/documents/1699301702_4465.html" target="_blank">2024 meeting schedule</a> was approved, with all but two of the monthly meetings to be held on the first Monday at 8:15. The exceptions are for January and September, when the first Monday is a holiday so the meeting will be the first Tuesday at 8:30. There is also a second meeting in December on the 23rd. Joint sessions with the Council are scheduled for July 16 and November 19.</p><p>The commissioners approved $200 for the Veteran's Office to host a quarterly training session for veteran service officers. They approved a final agreement with the DNR to close a section of 400E at the shooting range at Jasper-Pulaski. A signed agreement is required by statute. The Sheriff was granted permission to fill two vacant positions, a full-time 911 dispatcher and a part-time controller. The Commissioners again approved a carpet cleaning request from the Extension Office; it had approved this request some time ago but nothing was done.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a short discussion of W-2 forms. 126 County employees have not logged onto the doc delivery system the County has begun using that will allow the employees to download their W-2. The HR department will send reminders but in the end some W-2s will have to be printed. The Commissioners approved spending $21,611.06 to replace the fire-alarm system in the Sparling Annex. The old system is 26 years old, no longer works, and parts are no longer available to fix it. The extension office reports that some of its windows are leaking air and the blinds need to be repaired. They will be inspected to see what the best course of action is.</p><p>Animal Control was given permission to fill a vacancy. In the public comments a citizen read a statement urging the Commissioners to revisit the solar ordinance and to put a moratorium on new solar projects until the revision is finished. The meeting was continued until November 20 at 8:30 if needed.</p><p><b>Drainage Board meeting</b></p><p>After a short break, the Drainage Board, which is composed of the three Commissioners, met. They approved a proposal from NIPSC to install gas and electric to a new subdivision in the DeMotte buffer zone. The subdivision is an extension of an existing subdivision and will have 92 lots. Mr DeYoung abstained because he and his brother own the subdivision.</p><p>White Castle's drainage plan for its planned expansion was approved. At the Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission meeting in the evening there was mention that the old Soebe building would be demolished and that a new building would be built next to the existing factory, doubling its size.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3gBO_E6lX1tHN8WTSibw0yY5tn5eNoHXbENkdHcu/s1280/Soesbe9397.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="601" data-original-width="1280" height="300" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3gBO_E6lX1tHN8WTSibw0yY5tn5eNoHXbENkdHcu/w640-h300/Soesbe9397.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Walker Township solar farm submitted a preliminary drainage plan. This is a 60 megawatt project. The Board received the plan and gave them permission to move forward but no vote was taken. The Board will wait for the final plan before voting on approval.</p><p>Genova wants to add a 33,000 square foot parking lot for material storage. It will also be seeking to have an undeveloped section of Cherry Street vacated at the next Rensselaer Plan Commission meeting (Nov 9 at 5:30). The Board approved their drainage plans.&nbsp;</p><p>White County wants to clean a ditch that extends into Jasper County. The Board agreed to waive its rights, which is customary in cases like this. Jasper County will collect the ditch assessments and turn them over to White County.</p><p>The Board accepted maintenance certifications for the R. E. Davis and Sands ditches so maintenance collections can begin.</p><p>At 10:30 bids were opened on three projects, the R. E. Davis main ditch, the Davis laterals, and the Sands ditch. On the first two only Gutwein Evacuation bid and its bids were well under the Surveyor's estimate. The Gutwein bid on the Sands ditch was $21,500 and the other bid was $230,000.</p><p>In public comments a citizen suggested that the best way to deal with the problem of private and mutual drains in a solar development would be to have the development install a perimeter drain. Otherwise there is the risk of tiles being broken and not discovered until the project is completed and then repair is difficult and expensive.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Redevelopment meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission held a short meeting late on Thursday afternoon.They briefly discussed the former R&amp;M property. Titan is working on estimates for demolition and a party that previously had expressed interest in purchasing the building is again showing interest. The Park Department would like a new headquarters building and the Redevelopment Commission may be able to help. It is planned for the old tennis courts and will be a multipurpose building.&nbsp; At the next City Council meeting a committee may be formed to plan for the building.</p><p>The City is working with the County to get City water and sewer west of I-65. The next meeting will be December 4.</p><p><b>Chamber of Commerce lunch</b></p><p>The November Chamber of Commerce lunch was at the hospital and featured Carlos Vasquez as the speaker. It was lightly attended.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-ArMQEDXo879UEzafjYakwudFYWvoswtaeoJozkV/s1280/chamberlunchIMG_9399.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-ArMQEDXo879UEzafjYakwudFYWvoswtaeoJozkV/w640-h480/chamberlunchIMG_9399.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>Mr Vasquez said that planning for improvements began in 2020. Initially the plan was to modernize the interior with no new additions. Covid delayed everything, and in <a href="../../2022/10/a-ribbon-cutting-and-much-much-more.html" target="_blank">2022 the plan had changed</a> to adding to the building behind the emergency room, though this would eliminate the helipad. This updated plan was put out for bid and the bids came back $5 million over the $28 million approved for the project. The reason the bids were high is because construction costs have increased, in part because there has been a lot of health-care construction in Indiana. It is back to the drawing boards. The people involved are considering what might be done with the second floor, which is currently not being used. The problem with rehabilitating it is that the current regulations for hospitals are far more restrictive than they were when the hospital was built in 1963, so exemption may be needed.</p><p>He briefly mentioned Medicare Advantage plans, which hospitals hate. The plans make their money by restricting care. Regulations have made it unfeasible for Rensselaer Franciscan and most other rural hospitals to have maternity and delivery services. Mental health services are an increasing need. There are shortages of every type of health-care worker. No one wants to share a hospital room anymore; everyone wants a private room. Finally he passed around an award that the hospital and <a href="../../2022/09/confetti.html" target="_blank">Appleseed</a> received from the State. The State would like to see other rural hospitals find nontraditional ways to serve their communities as Franciscan-Rensselaer did by partnering with Appleseed.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvFYE253QQEGLC4K2sI0hIc4I5dQIVo18_Eq_FbVX/s1280/award9401.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1033" data-original-width="1280" height="516" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvFYE253QQEGLC4K2sI0hIc4I5dQIVo18_Eq_FbVX/w640-h516/award9401.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>We not only got our first freeze as October ended, but we got our first snow. It did not last very long; by afternoon it was mostly gone.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK9BsrVYcd_oWIJV3HFhXj8J9CcpDwm2cFib9gX7z/s1280/snowIMG_9383.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="960" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjK9BsrVYcd_oWIJV3HFhXj8J9CcpDwm2cFib9gX7z/w480-h640/snowIMG_9383.jpg" width="480" /></a></div><br /><p>There were three contested races in the Rensselaer municipal elections on Tuesday and a Republican won one, a Democrat won one, and an independent won one. Jeff Phillips easily defeated incumbent Mayor Stephen Wood, Jeff Rayburn narrowly beat Zyan Miller who had defeated George Cover in the primary, and Ernest Watson retained his seat by narrowly beating Richard Comingore. All other races were uncontested and the incumbent was reelected. Less than one third of registered voters cast ballots. Complete results&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jaspercountyin.gov/egov/documents/1699409798_16048.html" target="_blank">are here.</a></p><p>On the way to take a picture of the Soesbe building, I noticed a new building on Maple Street east of the ambulance building. The lot is owned by the Carnegie Players so I assume this is the storage building that they were hoping to build.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgW7YLHZrTTs5FvCFDIi3jxmS3j5ZizdVvRYxiHCqx/s1280/newBuilding9391.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="577" data-original-width="1280" height="288" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgW7YLHZrTTs5FvCFDIi3jxmS3j5ZizdVvRYxiHCqx/w640-h288/newBuilding9391.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>This coming weekend is a big shopping weekend, with Mistletoe Magic at the Fairgrounds, Shop and Stroll in Rensselaer, and the annual craft show at the Carnegie Center.</p><p>There are five baseball tournaments scheduled for the Blacker Fields in 2024, three in May and two in June.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=355592653651724&amp;set=a.184251027452555" target="_blank">annual St. Augustine Bazaar</a> takes place Thursday.</p><p>We have been getting a spam (or scam) call repeatedly. The caller asserts that we owe extra on something that we supposedly purchased (A Keto diet) and I think they want a credit card number. At least it provides a break from all the calls trying to pitch Medicare Advantage plans.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
