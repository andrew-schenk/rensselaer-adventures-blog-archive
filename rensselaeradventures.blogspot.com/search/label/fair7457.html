<p><b>&nbsp;Airport Authority meeting</b></p>The Jasper County Airport Authority met Tuesday evening and I attended in person rather than via Zoom. While the meeting was in progress, a large, strange aircraft landed. I was told that it was on the way to the UK. The company that owns it is developing hydrogen-electric engines but this plane runs on regular fuel.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheUNLxoONgpQYRU7EJODpOAOSgF-fij72piVGMnyE/s1280/aeroplane0119.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="530" data-original-width="1280" height="266" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheUNLxoONgpQYRU7EJODpOAOSgF-fij72piVGMnyE/w640-h266/aeroplane0119.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>At the meeting the Board heard from its engineers that a couple of reports had been submitted to the FAA and saw an updated plan for a new hangar. It is for a 214' by 60' building that will house eight planes. They heard a report about their investments in money-market funds and Treasury notes and bills. Someone is interested in land that the Airport owns along SR 114 but another estimate must be made before a sale can take place.<br /><br />The Board approved a new lease for a tenant in the old hangar building. Fuel sales were strong in May. The rental aircraft was damaged during a training flight and there was a long discussion of whether the rental policy needs to be modified. No action was taken but the airport manager will see how other airports handle damage by renters. The damage was light, only a bit more than $1000, and the Airport will cover it. There was a discussion of stumps from a line of trees that were removed; the ground is rocky and the stumps cannot be ground without damage to the grinder. Three insurance policy renewals were approved. There are eight students signed up for an airport class in the next school semester, four from RCHS, three from KVHS, and one from SNHS. The meeting ended with a discussion of maintenance on the rental plane.<br /><br />On the way to the meeting I noticed that the roads in the Fairgrounds had recently been seal coated.<br /><br /><b>Board of Public Works meeting</b><br /><br />The Rensselaer BPW met Monday afternoon and approved paying several bills from Commonwealth Engineering for work it has done: &nbsp;$10,335 on the water project, $20,000 for a preliminary engineering report required for SRF financing, and to bills of $5671 and 470.80 for work on the sewer project. The new water tower does not yet have its electrical work done and there is still work to be done on the existing water towers. The only other action it took was to approve fireworks at the Fair on July 27.<br /><br /><b>City Council meeting</b><br /><br />On Monday evening the Rensselaer City Council approved a request from Jasper County Tourism to paint a mural on the new water tower at the SR 114 and I-65 interchange. There was one member of the public who said that she preferred the water tower to remain without a mural. The project still needs some additional money to pay for the rental of the lift and for the clear coat layer.</div><div><br />The Council then had a second reading and approved three ordinances that were introduced at its previous meeting: ordinances establishing a redevelopment non-reverting fund, a Plan Commission non-reverting fund, and a fund for extending water and sewer to the west of I-65.</div><div><br />The gas tracker for June will reflect a 16&#162; increase per hundred cubic feet of use. The Council passed a resolution to document &nbsp;forgiving under-billed charges, a resolution that the State Board of Accounts wanted passed. The Council approved a pay request from Grimmer Construction of $295,863.85 for work on the Brick Street project and a request from Commonwealth Engineering of $32,448.25 for its work on this project. The Council approved a public relations request of $2000 for a City employee picnic at the end of July.</div><div><br />Some time this week concrete will be poured at the old light plant for a new floor. The space is being rehabilitated to become a new Park Department headquarters. There was a brief discussion about planning for the long-run future of the pool, but no action was taken.</div><div><br />This week work on the Brick Streets Project is construction of curbs and next week it should be on replacing sidewalks. There were five baseball tournaments scheduled for the Blacker Fields but the last two, scheduled for June, have been canceled. The new water main at the Fire Department has passed its tests. The Council approved having the Fair use a City garbage truck; this approval has been granted the last few years. The Council approved the Street Superintendent seeking bids for a new truck to pull the recycling trailer. Finally, the Council approved $8178 for a new flag pole to be installed in front of City Hall.</div><div><br /></div><div>Below are pictures of new the curbs taken on Tuesday. The corner of Van Rensselaer and Harrison will have a bump out.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTuGFKDoEmT9n5cBu4KcltH_ohl51PDeawhZzc_0I/s1280/bumpourIMG_0087.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTuGFKDoEmT9n5cBu4KcltH_ohl51PDeawhZzc_0I/w640-h480/bumpourIMG_0087.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The view from US 231.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEvPQq5dIOoifTdP6MaMSdYqMvpzqCc3tWmVR3JYf/s1280/curbIMG_0085.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEvPQq5dIOoifTdP6MaMSdYqMvpzqCc3tWmVR3JYf/w640-h480/curbIMG_0085.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b><br /><br />The Tourism Commission met on Tuesday morning. They approved a sponsorship the the Jasper County Historical Society's Memories Alive at Weston Cemetery, which will be held on September 21. This will be the seventh annual performance of this event. This year the focus will be on the eastern part of Weston Cemetery and as in the past few years will feature a morning program in the Hall Shelter of Brookside Park and an afternoon program in the Cemetery. An unofficial website for the event with past programs is <a href="http://ingrimayne.com/RENCEMWLK/" target="_blank">here</a>. (I am on the committee that plans this event.)<br /><br />The next item on the agenda was a funding request for painting a mural on the Rensselaer I-65 water tower. This project originated with JCEDO and the cost for painting the tower was estimated at $40,000, not including rental of a lift and applying a clear coat. There are two ways the Commission could fund this. It could come from the marketing budget. The mural is intended to highlight the murals that have been painted throughout Jasper County. JCEDO had been considering renting a billboard at a cost of $15,000 annually and had added money to the marketing budget. Alternatively, it could be funded as a capital project. Only the side of the tower facing the interstate will be painted.There was a discussion of how the costs were computed and eventually the members present decided they needed more information, so no action was taken at this meeting. Instead they plan to have another meeting, which members can attend via Zoom, next Tuesday (June 18) at 10:00.</div><div><br />The Commission approved joining the Indiana Tourism Association. It will provide networking opportunities and information about what other counties are doing. Two new employees were introduced, Angelica Potts-Bramlage who is in charge of Tourism and Community Development and Tori Smith who is an intern focused on publicity. Mrs Potts-Bramlage has previously worked in marketing for Indiana Beach and Fair Oaks Farms. Ms Smith is a recent grad from Ball State and will only be with Tourism until August when she leaves for Arizona to pursue graduate studies.</div><div><br />Finally the Commission heard a presentation from <a href="https://www.placer.ai/" target="_blank">Placer AI,</a> a company that specializes in location analytics. The company uses data from smartphones to track how many people visit just about any location in the US. They do not get the data from the carriers but from some of the apps that ask people to share their locations. They have data from about 30 million phones, which is about 9% of the U.S. population, and extrapolate from where these people are to estimate what everyone is. I was impressed with what they could show. They could select any area and tell how many people had visited that area during any time period in the last seven years. They could also tell where those people lived, where they worked, and what stores they shopped at. Using data from other sources, they could estimate incomes of the visitors and much else. The cost of an annual subscription for Jasper County Tourism would be about $26,000. The members of the Commission need to figure out how they might use the data that this company provides and whether it would be useful enough to justify the cost. No action was taken but the matter will probably be discussed further at their special meeting that the plan for next week.<br /><br /><b>Ag report</b><br /><br />The Farmers market has about as many vendors as it had last summer. I was interested in seeing what vegetables were available and found turnips, beets, onions, and greens in addition to the asparagus that was at the market when I stopped by a couple weeks ago. One vendor had tomatoes and summer squash that were grown in a hoop house in another county.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgH0f4e_fpSP3kg1Gk6iw9BTi1wxD8IX3Dm7hzYL2p/s1280/onionsIMG_0065.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgH0f4e_fpSP3kg1Gk6iw9BTi1wxD8IX3Dm7hzYL2p/w640-h480/onionsIMG_0065.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_tLnZ9CxwSPdLpbyaD8bcOJjCzhaSqREvc1tdHaY/s1280/turnipsIMG_0063.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_tLnZ9CxwSPdLpbyaD8bcOJjCzhaSqREvc1tdHaY/w640-h480/turnipsIMG_0063.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>I have harvested <a href="https://resprout.com/harvesting-garlic-scapes-when-why-how/" target="_blank">garlic scapes</a> in my garden and I did not see anyone offering that strange vegetable.</div><div><br /><div>The High School FFA had a booth.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-ioswxV2KCdd3VEPuozfwJQIntvKId0QHkzmyYId/s1280/FFA0066.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1006" data-original-width="1280" height="504" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-ioswxV2KCdd3VEPuozfwJQIntvKId0QHkzmyYId/w640-h504/FFA0066.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div>A usual item for sale was freeze dried candy.

<p><b>&nbsp;Joint Commissioners-Council meeting</b></p><p>The Commissioners and Council held a joint meeting on July 11 at 5:00. They briefly discussed&nbsp; County health insurance; the County switched providers this year. They then noted that EMS would require more dollars in the future and suggested a few ways that those dollars might be found.</p><p>Construction work is continuing on a new EMS building across the highway from the Fairgrounds entrance. Here is a picture from Tuesday.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUiQ25QaN4bOrQgvz3op7fUcQJFJwKd03EzyEbvei/s1280/Ambulance7431.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="527" data-original-width="1280" height="264" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUiQ25QaN4bOrQgvz3op7fUcQJFJwKd03EzyEbvei/w640-h264/Ambulance7431.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The last item on the agenda was a discussion of a grant writer. There is the impression that the County could obtain more grant money if there was a person tasked with finding grant opportunities and writing grants. At Tuesday's discussion the sentiment was to hire an individual rather than contract with a company.&nbsp;</p><p>In the other-business part of the meeting, a suggestion was made to construct a pole-barn type building behind Community Corrections that could be used for storage for the maintenance staff, space for the County Coroner to use, and space for training for Community Corrections. All three have been requesting additional space. The building might be funded by ARPA money. (Some of the remaining ARPA money will be used for sidewalks on two sides of the Courthouse and some to get City utilities to the west side of the Interstate.) The Health Department is willing to pay for an expansion of this parking lot at the Sparling Annex.&nbsp;</p><p>The new horse barn will be ready for Fair use. Below is a picture from Tuesday.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh33Pp_ftLH2vNfvvQvaT-y1P4esKUFLa1DHXGMvMa/s1280/horsebarn7441.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="611" data-original-width="1280" height="306" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh33Pp_ftLH2vNfvvQvaT-y1P4esKUFLa1DHXGMvMa/w640-h306/horsebarn7441.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The meeting ended at about 6:00. Unfortunately the County Council meeting did not start until 7:00 so there was a long wait. During that wait the Airport Authority Commission had its meeting at the Airport. I am not sure what it did, but before the meeting there was an executive session to discuss personnel. They may have hired an assistant manager.</p><p><b>County Council meeting</b></p><p>The County Council meeting approved a list of additional appropriations. Several were to allow the Sheriff to purchase an X-ray machine to examine incoming prisoners to detect any illegal drugs they might try to smuggle into the jail. The Council members have been given budget books so they can prepare for their August budget hearings, the big event for the Council.</p><p><b>Special Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Park Board did not have a meeting scheduled for July. However, an issue came up that needed immediate attention so a special meeting was called for the 12th. That issue was where to place a mural in the parks. The Board approved $2500, which matches the amount approved by Jasper County Tourism, for Rein Bontreger to put a mural on the bath house at the LaRue Pool during Art Week.&nbsp;</p><p>New mulch has been delivered to the playground at Brookside Park and was being spread this week. The Blacker Field Tournaments went well this year and none were rained out. Filson Park improvements are on hold pending more detailed engineering drawings that have to be submitted to the State. Those improvements need a conditional use variance from the City BZA that will not be on the agenda until an August meeting. Sports equipment has been delivered to Brookside Park and can be checked out when the Pool is open. On Monday at noon there will be a dedication ceremony for the Day courts, tennis and basketball. There will be a dedication for the Blacker Fields in August but no date has been set. The next Park Board meeting is scheduled for August 6.</p><p>I learned at the meeting that there are six murals scheduled for Rensselaer and four for Wheatfield this year.</p><p>The Rensselaer Plan Commission and BZA met Thursday evening but I did not attend because I took family members to the Children's Summer Theater performance. On the agenda at the Plan Commission meeting was a recommendation to the City Council to approve the new Comprehensive Plan, a revision of the ordinance on swimming pools, a revision to the zoning ordinance that will allow some residential uses in business districts, and a re-plat application. On the agenda for the BZA was a resolution to adopt a filing deadline for conditional use and variances of uses petitions, and a conditional use application to allow the sale of portable buildings on a property on North McKinley.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Notes&nbsp;</b></p><p>I<b> </b>noticed activity in the former Walgreens building on Friday.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKuXoN3n0JqP1S-ymMAArty-Ef53mhj6_kg3vx7K7/s1280/Walgreens7447.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="547" data-original-width="1280" height="274" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKuXoN3n0JqP1S-ymMAArty-Ef53mhj6_kg3vx7K7/w640-h274/Walgreens7447.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div>The new sidewalks along College Avenue were almost finished on Friday.<div><br /></div><div>Most or all of the meetings that would normally be scheduled for next week were moved because of the County Fair.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

<p><b>&nbsp;Winter lingers</b></p>We are less than a week away from the vernal equinox but winter is lingering. We woke up to snow on both Sunday and Monday.<div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqYkgBJoKoaw7_lQg8_7XU00-EUmKr_LhvqHuCj1x/s1280/winterlingers6423.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="857" data-original-width="1280" height="428" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqYkgBJoKoaw7_lQg8_7XU00-EUmKr_LhvqHuCj1x/w640-h428/winterlingers6423.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ee;"><br /></span></div>On March 16 we will finally get <a href="https://sunrise-sunset.org/us/rensselaer-in" target="_blank">12 hours of daylight</a>. (The atmosphere refracts or bends sunlight, so the sun appears above the horizon a bit earlier than it would if the earth had no atmosphere.)<br /><br /><b>Board of public works meeting</b><br /><br />The monthly Board of Public Works meeting was held Monday evening before the City Council meeting. It approved two task orders that will keep spending for lead line replacement separate from other spending for the waterworks project. This was done to satisfy the State Revolving Fund, which is providing money for the project. It also passed transferring $10,000 within the budget for Commonwealth Engineering, subject to USDA conference. This is for the lift-station project.</div><div><br />The Board approved a pay request #10 for Thieneman for $595,460 and for Commonwealth Engineering for $18,434 for the lift-station project. &nbsp;They approved a SRF disbursement request that involves a way of paying for services that I do not understand. Two firefighter applications were approved<br /><br /><b>City Council meeting</b><br /><br />At Monday's meeting the City Council approved an update to the building code that raises several fees and also approved changes to the policies and procedures ordinance that updates them to be consistent with changes the Council has made since 1917. A committee had spent several months preparing this update.<br /><br /></div><div>The gas tracker for March will reflect a 9.5&#162; decrease per hundred cubic feet. The electric tracker will reflect a $4.11 decrease per 1000 kilowatt hours. <br /><br /></div><div>Two bids were received and opened for the 2023 Community Crossings street work. One, from Milestone Contractors of Griffith, had a base bid of slightly more than a million dollars and the other, from Town and Country from DeMotte was for slightly less than a million dollars. The bids were given to the consultants from First Group to examine. They will bring back a recommendation that will probably be on the agenda of the March 27th meeting. The paperwork needs to be submitted to the State by April 6.</div><div><br />In the comments section of the meeting, Mr Cover said that he had been given a tour of the power plant and highly recommended that the other Council members take the same tour to see what was happening there. (After the meeting I heard mention that the City had received payment for the Wärtsilä&nbsp; engine, so sometime in the next few months it would be moved. That will be quite the task because it is huge.) The Forestry Council received a grant to plant 27 trees this year and for the fifteenth year Rensselaer has earned the Tree City designation. Some trees on the north of Brookside Park need to be taken down because they are shedding branches.</div><div>&nbsp; <br />The Street Department received permission to hire five summer employees. When work begins on the water tower near the Interstate, the underground piping will be installed before work on the tower itself is built.<br /><br /><b>Tourism Commission</b><br /><br />The Tourism Commission met Tuesday morning. The revenues from the inns-keeper tax are down this year compared to last year; the slowing economy seems to be a reason. The Wheatfield Chamber is working on raising money for a protective coating for the murals planned there this summer. They are still working on finding walls. In Rensselaer walls at Ayda's and City Hall ave been offered.</div><div>&nbsp; <br />There was a discussion of how to increase awareness of what the Tourism Commission does. One suggestion was that grants should be given with the provision that the Jasper County Tourism be acknowledged in the finished project. There is no signage recognizing Jasper County Tourism at the Blacker Fields even though Tourism gave $110,000 for the project.</div><div><br />There was a funding request from the LEAP (Leading the Education About Pigs) Foundation to help with a mural on the new Belstra Farm and Garden Greenhouse on SR 10 south of DeMotte. This is a new retail outlet. It is along the highway and the mural will be highly visible to traffic. No artist has been selected yet. The Commission approved a grant of $4500.</div><div><br />Last month the Commission heard a proposal for a new horse barn at the Fairgrounds but wanted more information, especially about other funding. The project has found $8000 in outside funding and the Fair Board has met and said that they would pick up whatever funding is needed beyond this and a grant from Tourism. The Horse area has 18 events scheduled for this year, beginning in April and continuing to October and they attract many out-of-state visitors. After a discussion that drifted to talking about whether and how people who camp at the Fairgrounds should be charged the inns-keeper tax, the Commission approved a grant of $40,000. The hope is that the building will be up in June or July.</div><div><br />This was the last meeting for JCEDO director Stephen Eastridge. The JCEDO Board was aware of his upcoming departure about six weeks ago and a replacement is in the works. No name was given.<br /><br /><b>Other things</b><br /><br />The Jasper County Airport Authority met on Tuesday evening and most of the meeting was devoted to the nuts and bolts of running the airport. The Board approved hiring an intern for the summer. There was discussion of the possibility of hiring an assistant manager, a topic that will come up in future meetings. The airport course for high school students, which was a dream of the previous airport manager, may finally happen in the fall. The board passed some fees for aerial applicators (crop dusters) who use the airport.<br /><br />The Rensselaer Plan Commission met on February 9. The meeting was very short. It passed a recommendation that will go to the City Council, which will set up a way to fund art with money coming from the Redevelopment Commission.<br /><br />On Saturday the Rensselaer Library had its annual free Train Day with some elaborate model train sets.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOOUWRIKgCEm3utMDkVQHST3JSdZcPgKCTHhHUJ9k/s1280/trainday6411.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="621" data-original-width="1280" height="310" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOOUWRIKgCEm3utMDkVQHST3JSdZcPgKCTHhHUJ9k/w640-h310/trainday6411.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhS9McLAYDepsysLfnnyh2sNXswCEg-SIcokfUA49k/s1280/minitrain6409.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="913" data-original-width="1280" height="456" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhS9McLAYDepsysLfnnyh2sNXswCEg-SIcokfUA49k/w640-h456/minitrain6409.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdBVLx_cmLEPlXKdI2dOhtNp3_LXINSgIPPwf8eo3/s1280/traintracks6400.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="1025" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjdBVLx_cmLEPlXKdI2dOhtNp3_LXINSgIPPwf8eo3/w512-h640/traintracks6400.jpg" width="512" /></a></div><br /><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><br /></div>

It approved an update of the pursuit policy for the Police Department. It was a policy that the State introduced to bring uniformity among police departments and will not result in changes in the way the Rensselaer Department conducts pursuits. The Board also approved a promotion in the Police Department.</p><p>The Board then approved two task orders for Commonwealth Engineering. The first was for chemical phosphorus removal. This was required by IDEM and will cost $72,000. The second was for wastewater asset management and is a study needed to get funds from the Indiana State Revolving Fund (SRF). It was for $59,800.</p><p>The Board then approved the bid recommendations for the water project. (The bids were opened at a <a href="../../2023/01/miscellany-mid-january.html" target="_blank">special January meeting</a>.) The bid for the water-tower part of the project of $4,341.000 that includes the base bid and several of the alternates was approved, as was the bid of $2,202,865 for the water mains base bid and one of the alternates. The approval was contingent on SRF approval. It was noted that the bids were higher than the estimates, but pretty much everything is coming in on the high side.</p><p>The Board approved pay request #9 of $566,723.95 from Thieneman for the lift station construction and also $25,669.90 to Commonwealth for monitoring the construction. Commonwealth also had an invoice of $34,995.12 for the final design of the elevated storage project and for $5,315.24 for bid assistance for that project.</p><p><b>City Council meeting&nbsp;</b></p><p>The City Council meeting lasted more than an hour, which is unusually long for these meetings. First up was a citizen who was upset with the sewer extension. She maintained that the new sewer hookup would cost her rather than save her money. She will now have to pay a sewer bill and it will cost about $3500 to connect her house to the sewer line. Her septic system was cheaper.</p><p>Next up was an ordinance authorizing the City to issue revenue bonds for the waterworks improvement project. The funding will be from the SRF and $2 million will be a forgivable loan (so a grant) and another $5.9 million will have an interest rate of zero percent. Because the closing is scheduled for the 24th, the Council passed the second reading and then passed the third reading of the ordinance. (The first reading had been passed at the previous meeting and this type of ordinance requires three separate votes.)</p><p>The process of annexing SJC began at this meeting. There are multiple steps, including a public hearing (scheduled for March 27) and the preparation of a fiscal plan. If all goes as planned, the annexation will be finished in June.</p><p>The Council approved an amendment to the salary ordinance affecting the assistant street superintendent. The gas tracker for February will reflect a 5.25&#162; increase per hundred cubic feet. There was a presentation of the status of the comprehensive plan that used the same power-point slides as those used at the Plan Commission meeting on the 9th. The presenter noted that the organization of the plan might seem a bit confusing but this organization was used to make it easy for OCRA to review it.&nbsp;</p><p>Two employees were recognized for ten years of service. Two requests for public relations funds, one for flowers for the funeral of an employee's wife, were approved. April 22 will be electronics recycling day, from 8:00 until noon.</p><p><b>Tourism Board meeting</b></p><p>The Tourism Board met on Valentine's Day at the Sparling Annex. Art week will be July 24-28 and the focus for murals will be Wheatfield. The walls that can be painted are more clustered than in DeMotte and that will give the event a more festival feel for the artists.</p><p>There was a funding request for a new horse barn at the Fairgrounds. In addition to use for the County Fair, the horse grounds are used for 18 booked events, most of which bring in outsiders to the Fairgrounds. The planned barn will be 62' by 80'. The Board was receptive but wanted to know what other sources of funds will be used because they do not want to approve funding and not have the building completed. It will probably be on the agenda for the March 14 meeting.</p><p>A citizen who would like to see one of the miniature trains manufactured in Rensselaer many years ago installed in a park wanted to know if that sort of project could receive Tourism funding. He was told it could. Time will tell if anything develops from this.</p><p><b>Airport Authority Board meeting</b></p><p>The most interesting item from the Airport Authority Board meeting was a discussion with a company called American Crop Care that would like to base its operations at the Jasper County Airport. The company is incorporated in Florida but its main pilot who also seems to be one of the owners lives in Winamac. The company is new and is in the crop dusting business. That business is seasonal and they plan to rent a plane for the crop dusting season and would like to rent a hangar or two for that season. This is new territory for the airport and the Board members had questions about insurance, storage of chemicals, and fuel sales. The company and the airport manager will try to work out a mutually beneficial agreement that can be approved at or before the next meeting.</p><p>The Airport has invested their funds in several allowable instruments, all of which are getting about 4% interest. They declared their courtesy car as surplus and will put it in the next County auction. They also discussed a variety of things that needed repairs or replacement and other airport issues that are important to the airport but are not of much public interest.</p><div><b>A few more pictures</b></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="../../2023/02/a-second-february-post.html" target="_blank">Last week I wrote about the Plan Commission</a> and a variance for D-1 Towing.

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
