<p>Have you noticed that tulip trees are blooming?</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNrVTPsOXEPZTV8Ly_I_I2FkbkCcQOPCKI4LpyvqH/s1280/Tulip0537.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="989" data-original-width="1280" height="494" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNrVTPsOXEPZTV8Ly_I_I2FkbkCcQOPCKI4LpyvqH/w640-h494/Tulip0537.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The flowers are large, but usually high in the tree where they blend in.<br /><p><b>Northern lights</b></p><p>On Friday night and Saturday morning many people in our area saw the Northern Lights. The display was caused by strong solar storms that ejected ionized particles in Earth's direction. They are caught in the Earth's magnetic field and funneled into the upper atmosphere, especially near the poles.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the people commented that the pictures that they took with their phones showed a lot more than what they could see with their eyes. Human eyes have two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones. Cones see color and are concentrated in one small area of the back of the eye. They turn off when in low light conditions and rods take over. Rods see only black and white and are not abundant where the cones are concentrated. That is why if you are looking for a faint object in the sky, you will see it better if you focus a little to the side of the object.&nbsp; If you did not see the color in the Northern Lights that the pictures captured, it is because your cones were inactive. Modern smartphones have much greater sensitivity to low light than human eyes.</p><p>I did not see the aurora but did see a number of pictures on Facebook, including some from family living in Kentucky. Here is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=823197576508301&amp;set=pcb.823198493174876" target="_blank">link to pictures</a> taken from Fountain Park Chautauqua&nbsp;</p><p>By the way, if the solar storms get too strong, they can cause a lot of damage here on Earth to electrical systems. We do not need another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event" target="_blank">Carrington Event</a>, but sooner or later Earth will experience one.</p><p><b>Board of Public Works meeting</b></p><p>The BPW meeting on Monday afternoon was short, lasting only ten minutes. It approved invoices for water utility improvements from Commonwealth Engineering for $9,087 and from Maguire Iron for $359,575. This&nbsp; project is now 76% complete. They also approved an applicant for the Fire Department. The fire tower construction has been pushed back ten to twelve weeks and the Fall training class has been canceled.</p><p><b>City Council meeting</b></p><p>After the usual preliminaries, the City Council considered an extension for a sewer hook-up along SR 114. The applicant has had trouble getting her contractor to install the hook-up because of the extensive rain this Spring. She was granted a 60 day extension. There are several other people in that area that are supposed to be hooking up to the City sewer and they apparently have not done so yet.</p><p>Rein Bontreger requested closing a block of Front Street on Thursday evenings from May 23 to September 26 for his weekly Cylinders-and-Snacks car show. This will be the fifth year for the event. His request was granted. He said that next year he may move the event to the new bricks of Harrison Street. The old power lines on that section of Harrison Street were removed on Saturday as the Electric Department switched power from the overhead lines to newly installed underground lines. The power to the Court House had to be turned off during the transfer.</p><p>The Council acknowledged an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122147017484183430&amp;set=a.122098397264183430" target="_blank">apprenticeship graduation</a> from the Alliance of Indiana Rural Water. The Alliance helps pay the costs of completing the program and I believe there is another City employee in the program. Licensed operators for utility operations are in short supply nationally as well as locally and the program is trying to improve the situation.</p><p>The Council then turned to renewing several tax abatements. ConAgra had two, one personal property and the other real estate, as did National Gypsum. IMPA had two, one for each solar park. Indiana Facemasks had two, both for personal property, and Geyer American Melt Blown had one. There was another Geyer company that had had an abatement, but it has closed and the employees folded into the other Geyer businesses. Indiana Facemasks no longer produces as many face masks, but it has added other products. Finally, Genova had a real-estate abatement reapproved.</p><p>The Council approved a payment claim for the Brick Street Redevelopment for $208K. I asked before the meeting why these claims came to the Council rather than the Board of Public Works and was told because the source of funding was different from those that go to the BPW. The gas tracker for May will reflect a 33&#162; decrease per hundred cubic feet. The Council moved the next Council meeting to Tuesday, May 28 because the 27th is Memorial Day.&nbsp; (There will be a Memorial Day Ceremony on May 27 at Weston Cemetery at 11:00.)</p><p>Four people have submitted applications for the open School Board Position. There will be no BZA or Plan Commission meetings this month. For clean-up week, five cars were towed. Ten loads of metal were collected as well as 55.4 tons of yard waste, 11 gaylord boxes of electronics, 98 tires, 37.1 tons of brush, and 218.4 tons of trash.</p><p>Below is a picture taken last week as the City's electric utility was installing a transformer on the corner of the Courthouse square.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfcs_B0KDENK7p-5gLRece23DC9s_DhVRBiXT9DV_/s1280/transfomer0441.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="639" data-original-width="1280" height="320" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfcs_B0KDENK7p-5gLRece23DC9s_DhVRBiXT9DV_/w640-h320/transfomer0441.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Tourism Commission</b></p><p>The Tourism Commission met Tuesday morning and approved three funding or sponsorship requests. They approved $5000 to both the Touch of Dutch Festival and the Little Cousin Jasper Festival and $1700 to the DAR for Wreaths Across America.&nbsp;</p><p>The members were told to expect lower tax receipts for May and June. Higher interest rates have depressed construction and thus the demand for housing for construction workers. There was mention that a lot of people who schedule job interviews do not show; apparently the ease of scheduling with some of the Internet sites is a cause.</p><p><b>Airport Authority meeting</b></p><p>I missed the past two Airport Authority meetings but did remember the May meeting. I was thinking of attending in person but the weather looked iffy so I attended via Zoom.</p><p>There is interest in a couple properties that the Airport owns along SR 114. Time will tell if anything develops. The Board approved a lease of a hangar. Fuel sales in April were surprisingly good. There was a discussion of maintenance issues with the rental plane and the Board approved an amendment to the rental contract. The Board approved sending the Airport's bobcat to the County auction; it has not been used recently. Helicopter rides are scheduled this summer but biplane rides are uncertain. One of the people renting hangar space would like to build a private hangar and there was a discussion about that. The Airport has an area west of Excel Air designated for private-hangar development but that land is currently in a hay lease. The Board is interested in pursuing this but needs more information. There was a discussion of the airport class offered to high school students and the Board approved an estimate for removing a line of trees.&nbsp;</p><p>The Airport has a <a href="http://jaspercountyairport.com/" target="_blank">redesigned website</a> and you can find minutes of past meetings there.</p><p><b>Solar Ordinance amendments</b></p><p>One of the items on the May 20 Plan Commission meeting will be amendments to the County solar ordinance. I obtained a copy of the changes from the Planning office to see what was proposed because I suspect there will be many interested citizens at the meeting.</p><p>The changes add utility scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) to the ordinance that are capable of releasing more than one megawatt of electricity for an hour. Setbacks for solar farms are proposed to be 300 feet from non-participating land owners unless the non-participating owner owns land on more than one side, and then they are increased. The setbacks for a BESS are 900 feet. A Solar energy facility must be larger than 10 acres but a BESS cannot be larger than ten acres. Fencing is required for both types of facilities. "Any CESS must be buffered by planting, farming, production agriculture and maintained in good husbandry." A BESS must have a three-foot berm. Exterior lighting is limited to the amount needed for security. There are provisions for fire control, wetlands and erosion control, and several paragraphs about insurance.</p><p><b>Another picture</b></p><p>There has been movement forward at Filson Park.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKggM0CvoZ6MKHDN8wRvri_kmtWapwit3C6jX8Q_I/s1280/FountainBase0527.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="898" data-original-width="1280" height="450" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKggM0CvoZ6MKHDN8wRvri_kmtWapwit3C6jX8Q_I/w640-h450/FountainBase0527.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>I am curious to see how they will hook up the water.</p>

There were four buried cable permits, three of which were simple bores under a road. The other seemed not to have been a bore but a changing of above-ground cables necessitated by a State Highway bridge replacement and now these also need to fill out a permit form. All were approved.&nbsp;</p><p>The REMC broadband manager addressed the Commissioners, telling them that REMC wants to start Phase Two of its plans to provide broadband to the County. Phase One, which was building a ring of towers, has been completed. Phase Two will connect homes to fiber optics in the northeast part of the County. (There will be phases three and four to provide fiber optics to the remainder of the County.) This part of the County is the least well served part of the County. The project will be funded by REMC and by State and Federal grants. It will include about 135 miles of cable, with about 108 on existing poles and 27.4 underground. About 1400 homes will be served. All phases will use about 400 miles of cable. There was no approval of this plan at this meeting because the required paperwork has not been finished. The goal of REMC and County officials (Highway and Surveyor) is to have the plan ready for approval at the end-of-the-year meeting on December 28, REMC hopes to complete this phase in 80 working days once it is started.</p><p>There was a public hearing at which no one spoke for an ordinance to put stop signs at one intersection and to put speed limits on sections of CR 900W and CR 1000W. The ordinance was approved. The Commissioners also approved an ordinance that increased the cost of highway culvert delivery from $50 to $150. County Treasurer McEwan had a case of repeatedly trying to have a property owner make good on a check with insufficient funds. The Commissioners approved something that will allow the property to go to the tax sale if payment on what is owed is not paid.</p><p>The Commissioners approved a proposal of the Sheriff to pay for accumulated vacation pay of an employee. They also approved filling several current or upcoming vacancies. The Commissioners told the Sheriff that they appreciated the good relations that they have with his department; at a recent meeting with other commissioners they heard horror stories about counties that had bad relationships between commissioners and sheriffs. The Sheriff was asked about license-plate readers. The cameras on the I65/SR10 intersection have worked well and have resulted in several arrests. The others in various other places were provided by a different vendor and the Sheriff is opting out of that contract because of poor service. He will seek a different vendor. He mentioned that there is a lot of Covid in the jail.&nbsp;</p><p>The Commissioners had no suggestions to fill a vacancy on the Library Board but did approve Diva Rish for the Tourism Board. A member of the Animal Control Board sent a letter saying that he did not want to be reappointed and they approved a replacement for him. The County currently houses juvenile defenders in Porter County but Porter County has notified the judges that they will not be renewing that agreement. The County will have to find another County for juvenile offenders and the cost will probably be higher.&nbsp;</p><p>In public comments a woman asked what was happening with the tax cliff that was expected as the result of NIPSCO abandoning the Schahfer plant. She was told that the cliff will largely be averted because of the Dunn's Bridge solar farms built and being built in the northeast part of the County.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Drainage Board</b></p><p>The Drainage Board, meeting a few minutes after the end of the Commissioners meeting, had several items on its agenda. A person living next to the South Bailey Ditch asked for a variance so he could build an attached garage onto his house. The right of way for the ditch is 75 feet and the edge of the garage would be only 42 feet away. In the past the Drainage Board would have rejected this variance, but the fact that the house is at the very start of the ditch was important to the current members. They approved the variance with the conditions that the landowner take care of the maintenance of his part of the ditch and that he sign a hold-harmless agreement saying he will not sue the County if he suffers any damage as the result of being closer than 75 feet to the ditch.</p><p>The Board approved a drainage plan for phase B of the Briarwood subdivision. The drainage plan had been approved in 1993 but DeMotte did something that required it to be re-approved for the undeveloped part of the subdivision.</p><p>NIPSCO received approval to cross a regulated drain as part of a bridge replacement project of INDOT.</p><p>A citizen noted that there were two beaver dams on ditches near her in northern Jasper County. The Surveyor commented that there had been a lot of beaver dams this year, over 35.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>Former Indiana Representative Douglas Gutwein died on December 1.

<p><b>Veterans Day</b></p><p>On Saturday the City held the annual Veterans Day ceremony at Weston Cemetery. The crowd was quite small, but I saw no mention of the event on social media. Perhaps Yodel for Rensselaer should have been started a couple months earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigLeyIDRRxmKsRW_62LY5L-AsOS_8W-N4380QXEQC/s1280/VeteransDay2023_9412.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="604" data-original-width="1280" height="302" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigLeyIDRRxmKsRW_62LY5L-AsOS_8W-N4380QXEQC/w640-h302/VeteransDay2023_9412.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p><b>Rensselaer Plan Commission</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Plan Commission met on Thursday evening. They approved the vacating of the east end of Cherry Street that is between Lirio and Genova. This part of the street has never been developed and Genova, which owns land on both sides according to the GIS map wants to use this area for storage of materials. The approval by the Plan Commission is only a recommendation. The City Council has final say.&nbsp;</p><p>At the the previous meeting the Commission had considered and then tabled a request to change the zoning of a couple lots along Melville from I1 to R1. The Commission was reluctant to rezone only part of a block and wanted to know what the other property owners wanted. The person who owns most of the lots did not want it rezoned because he is using a couple lots for business purposes. After discussing several options, including rezoning half the block, the matter was again tabled so that options could be discussed with the other property owners.&nbsp;</p><p>The Commission briefly discussed but took no action on the ordinance amendment that the Council tabled at its last meeting, with Council members saying it was too vague and open to misuse: "Where twenty five percent (25%) or more of the lots in a block frontage are occupied by existing buildings, all exterior architectural styles and materials shall be the same type or an alternative that simulates a complementary material and style."</p><p>There was a discussion of buffer zone expansion. The buffer zone can be up to two miles from City limits and with the annexation of St Joseph's College, there is now more land that can be in the buffer zone. There was also discussion of some overlay districts, such as the airport, which can have stricter requirements. For example, the FAA must approve some things within 4000 feet of runways.</p><p>There was mention that SJC will be requesting a change in zoning at the next meeting, to be held Dec 7 at 5:00. They will want a parcel changed from RS to R1 zoning. I searched for what RS zoning is and found the Rensselaer zoning ordinance <a href="../../../www.rensselaer.in.gov/egov/documents/1283874660794.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>&nbsp;The ordinance is 198 pages long. RS is residential suburban and R1 is residential. The RS zoning requires an acre of land per house while the R1 zoning only requires a lot size of 7500 square feet. As I understood the discussion, and I could not see the TV screen that the Commission members were viewing, the area to be rezoned will be west of Sparling Avenue south of the Health Department. It will be used for building trades construction, and I think that the students will be from area high schools. I look forward to learning more about what SJC is planning.</p><p>The last bit of business was an unadvertised request to separate a house from a 3.5 acre lot in the City's buffer zone. The owner wants to keep the grain storage bins but does not want to be a landlord. The attorney wondered why this could not be approved contingent on have the survey completed, but was told that the survey had to be done first. Since it had not been advertised, no action could be taken.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Board of Public Works meeting</b></p><p>The Monday Board of Public Works meeting had only two members present. Rich Odle has resigned. He has sold his house and moved, so probably is no longer eligible to serve.</p><p>The Board approved the vacating of the eastern and undeveloped part of Cherry Street. That approval is only a recommendation to the City Council, which will have the item on its agenda for the second meeting of November. The Board also approved a promotion of a police officer from master patrolman to corporal.&nbsp;</p><p>Next it approved paying a series of bills. It approved partial pay request #18 for $300,000 from Theineman for work on the phosphorus removal station at the waste water treatment plant and two invoices from Commonwealth Engineering for other work on this station, one for $846.43 and the other for $23.05. For the Water project they approved several SRF disbursement requests, $6,193 to Commonwealth for engineering, $389,500 to McGuire Iron for work on the water tower, and $760,176 to Grimmer Construction for replacing lead service lines. As of Monday 102 have been finished and there are funds for only one more replacement but eight others have the easements finished and the City will try to find funds to complete these. Applications from three people to join the Fire Department were approved. The meeting lasted a bit over 15 minutes.</p><p><b>City Council meeting</b></p><p>Monday's City Council meeting began with the Council sending a zoning ordinance back to the Plan Commission without the paragraph mentioned above in the summary of the Plan Commission meeting. The gas tracker for November reflects a 46&#162; decrease per hundred cubic feet of use. A person from Baker-Tilly gave the Council members a report on the four utilities and said it was up to the Council to decide if they wanted similar reports in the future or if they wanted other things to be reported. He noted that the sewer may need more revenue to finance upcoming projects that are State mandated.</p><p>The Council heard a request to close the rest of the alley behind Fenwicks but Council members wanted to make sure that none of the businesses would be harmed. The Council approved spending $18,900 to exchange a tractor that the Street Department considers a lemon with a new tractor. The Council also approved purchase of 10 mobile log-ins for maps showing the City utility infrastructure that was recently inventoried and mapped. This will give field access to the information and a couple of utilities said it could be very useful. The initial cost will be $6700 with an annual fee of $2400.</p><p>Rick Odle's move from the City creates a vacancy on the Rensselaer Central School Board. The City is seeking applicants to fill the remaining six months of his term and the submission deadline is December 4. The Council changed the date of its December 25th meting to the 26th. It approved public relations request of $200 to buy candy and supplies for the Christmas parade (Dec 4). The Fire Department was given approval to purchase pipes for a water main needed for its proposed fire tower training facility. It received two bids and the low bid was $34,233.25.</p><p><b>Tourism Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Tourism Commission meeting on Monday began with the approval of the August minutes. (The September meeting did not have a quorum and the October meeting was canceled.) Two big items keeping the Tourism office busy are upcoming meetings with a group from Ball State that will be developing a strategic plan and the roll out of the Yodel calendar for Rensselaer. People from Yodel are reaching out to organizations to invite them to some zoom sessions and if you are contacted, it is in your interest to get your organization on Yodel, which will be rolling out in December. It is a community calendar and also a resource guide to organizations. You can see what it will be like by looking at the <a href="https://events.yodel.today/crawfordsville/" target="_blank">Yodel page for Crawfordsville</a>. Click the events link to get items organized on a calendar and the org tag to see the organizations with their specific events.</p><p>The Commission members will meet with the group from Ball State this week to give them information to help them get started on the strategic plan. The next tourism meeting on December 12 to be held at eMbers will invite various stakeholders to give their input into the process.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the meeting was devoted to a presentation and then a discussion of a plan by Greg Whaley to bring a miniature train that was manufactured in Rensselaer to a Rensselaer park. (<a href="../../2023/10/a-tale-of-four-meetings.html" target="_blank">See here</a> for his presentation at a Park Board meeting.) Mr Whaley needs to have funding available so that when one of these trains becomes available, he can move quickly. However, government funding is designed to be slow, with bills paid with a delay. The Commission members present liked the idea, but did not think the plan was detailed enough for them to act. Plus it was not clear to them how they could make the funding available in a way that he could make a quick decision. The Tourism director will work with Mr Whaley and someone from the Park Corporation to flesh out the plan and a budget and hopefully someone from the Park Corporation will be at the next meeting to help explain the role of the Parks.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Airport Authority meeting</b></p><p>The Airport Authority meeting began with one of its engineers reporting how the FAA had dealt with the forecast that the Airport had prepared, a step in developing a master plan. The FAA accepted the forecast but did not accept the traffic count that the airport provided. There was discussion of how the airport could document its traffic count. The Commission voted to proceed with development of the master plan. This is all part of a very long and slow process that has to meet FAA approval because the FAA funds most of the development of airports.</p><p>After discussing a variety of airport operations, the members approved a spending limit to replace a 2012 computer, discussed a possible replacement for a member who is leaving the Commission at the end of the year, and approved a motion to begin design work on a new hangar and its bid process.</p><div><b>Notes</b></div><p>On my way to the City Council meeting, I noticed that Jupiter is bright in the eastern sky. I have noticed that Venus is very bright in east before sunrise.</p><p>The St A's Bazaar attracted a large crowd despite competing with the Rensselaer Plan Commission meeting.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixg3pzXkwKN-TUXHVzMCEVO2NN4RgHIjW6gKxOi3r/s1280/Bazaar9410.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="552" data-original-width="1280" height="276" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixg3pzXkwKN-TUXHVzMCEVO2NN4RgHIjW6gKxOi3r/w640-h276/Bazaar9410.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The park shelter in Filson Park looks like it has been completed.

They are not quite as bright this week.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF-w1X55BHJuSkTqrKwfhyphenhyphenGZBbi7cnf/s1280/trees9407.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="946" data-original-width="1280" height="474" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF-w1X55BHJuSkTqrKwfhyphenhyphenGZBbi7cnf/w640-h474/trees9407.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I noticed another business has moved into the old REMC building, Willowtree Therapeutic Services.

I keep seeing adds for Black Friday sales before Thanksgiving. I remember when Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, was a special day of sales, but I think the efforts by retailers to get a jump on the day have diluted the actual Black Friday.

It has been several years since there have been health fairs in Rensselaer and because I found <a href="../../2009/02/health-fair.html" target="_blank">them</a> useful in <a href="../../2014/10/health-fair.html" target="_blank">the past</a>, I decided to go to this one.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEV2b9ZfXEj_NeZ50sBSH2-n2L9Vl6imPTE8drRXD/s1280/HealthIMG_9295.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEV2b9ZfXEj_NeZ50sBSH2-n2L9Vl6imPTE8drRXD/w640-h480/HealthIMG_9295.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>I was there early and in the time I was there, few other people entered. Perhaps attendance picked up later.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4wD6knBV3ErmyFoHC2QCbpMmFZ2_c5A-4rHhhSZp/s1280/HealthFairIMG_9296.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4wD6knBV3ErmyFoHC2QCbpMmFZ2_c5A-4rHhhSZp/w640-h480/HealthFairIMG_9296.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>This fair was a bit different from past fairs. The only testing that I saw was for blood pressure by the County Health Department. Most of the booths provided information about their services and gave out a variety of freebies. I was disappointed that I did not get the testing information, but I enjoyed all the freebies. There is another Health Fair scheduled for April 23, 2024.</p><p><b>Mayoral Debate</b></p><p>The Chamber of Commerce sponsored a Mayoral Debate on Thursday. It had a rigid format and the Chamber had requested that questions be submitted before the debate. Each candidate was given an opportunity to respond to the question in a very limited time. Among the questions asked were questions whether bulk pickup could be done twice a year, what improvements each would like to make, what they would do to clean up the city and yards, how high speed internet access can be insured and if the City should become a provider, how they can get businesses to move to Rensselaer, what they could do to deal with homelessness, whether they would consider going back to the the trash stickers instead of the monthly charges. Other questions asked what can be done with Saint Joes, what can be done with the drug problem, to explain why the power plant was shut down, what is the biggest problem facing Rensselaer, and what they thought of CO2 sequestering.&nbsp;</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifqpOkx1q9MtdhgvSMR3tupEp1UTEHwwDgaXt-WiB/s1280/MayoralIMG_9300.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifqpOkx1q9MtdhgvSMR3tupEp1UTEHwwDgaXt-WiB/w640-h480/MayoralIMG_9300.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><br /><p>After these questions were asked and answered, there was still time so the audience was invited to ask questions. Candidates had suggested Rensselaer needed more housing and one question is whether we also have a need for more apartments. One person asked if they would support expanding recycling to more types of plastics and another wanted to know what we could do to promote Rensselaer tourism. Another asked how Rensselaer can keep its young people from moving out and another expressed disappointment that there was only one family restaurant.</p><p>The whole event was very well run and if you are interested in how the candidates answered, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GRCOC/videos/1776831186088924" target="_blank">the video of the event</a> is on Facebook here.</p><p><b>Last City Council meeting of October</b></p><p>In the City Council of Monday evening, October 23, the first item on the agenda was an amendment to the zoning ordinance. Noelle Weishaar thought that one part of it, which restricted new construction and possibly remodeling to be consistent with existing styles was vague, possibly subject to abuse, and would raise the cost of building. After discussion, other members of the Council agreed and the item was sent back to the Plan Commission for reconsideration.&nbsp;</p><p>The Council did pass a revised ordinance that increases the fee to those who use the Rensselaer Police to monitor their alarm systems by two dollars. The justification was the cost to the Department has risen. The fee is less than the fees of private security companies that monitor alarm systems. After discussion, the Council approved a new salary ordinance that incorporates a number of salary changes. There was agreement that these changes should be decided when the budgets are submitted.</p><p>Work on water connections is finished on Weston Street and has moved to Front Street. Patching the holes from the construction will begin soon. Metal is arriving at the site of the new water tower near the I-65/SR-114 intersection. The City will find out this week if it will get a recycling grant and if it does, it will be used for a new leaf vac. The Park Department received approval to replace a 20-year-old tractor that is having mechanical problems. The meeting was adjourned at 6:50.</p><p>Wildlife sightings</p><p>I saw this little snake on the Washington Street Bridge. I think it was taking advantage of the warmth from the concrete. It is the only snake I have seen this year.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZoobWz4KBad7E_Dw-WGWPs6Vl58I6RSQ24cOhQzf/s1446/Snake.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1400" data-original-width="1446" height="620" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZoobWz4KBad7E_Dw-WGWPs6Vl58I6RSQ24cOhQzf/w640-h620/Snake.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>I have seen four praying mantises this year.

The hearing was for the abandonment of more of a tile that had been partially abandoned a few years ago. There were no public comments and the abandonment was approved.</p><p>The agenda of the Commissioners meeting had nothing of great public interest. The Commissioners approved a couple of buried cable requests, one a simple bore under a road to connect to water and the other for fiber optic cable. They approved a request from the Recorder to move from local servers to a cloud site to help avoid a cyber attack. Two thirds of Indiana counties have already made this kind of move. The voting center for the Rensselaer municipal election will be at the Fairgrounds. No mention was made of the Fire Station. Main Street Rensselaer asked permission to use a bit of the Courthouse lawn for OktoberFest and it was granted. The Sheriff's Department needs to upgrade the 911 equipment and the lowest quote they found was $335,000 and the Commissioners approved the contract pending legal review. The Commissioners also approved replacing a deputy and a corrections officer. Bids were approved for flooring and painting in Community Corrections and waterproofing the Courthouse basement.</p><p>The Highway Department contracted out some of the snow removal in subdivisions last winter and wants to continue that contracting this year and the Commissioners approved the request. They approved hiring early for a person retiring so the new person will be able to train with the soon-to-be retiree. Someone had floated the idea to one of the Commissioners of finding a barn and moving it to the Fairgrounds as an event center. The Commissioners were favorable to exploring the ideal. The Wheatfield Fire Department wants to build a new fire station near the high school and is considering including a splash pad. Project Ribeye has not seen eye-to-eye with DeMotte and is considering locating in Porter County.</p><p>The people from BP were at the meeting to discuss their plans for seismic testing in Jasper County. They have been doing testing in Benton County and seem to have run into some kind of issue. They would like to continue on into Jasper County, but the road-use agreement needs to be approved or revised. After a bid of discussion, the Commissioners decided to have a special meeting on Tuesday at 8:30 am at the Highway Department. (The conference room in the Sparling Annex had been reserved for some other meeting at that time.) BP will host another open house in Jasper County, this one at the Connection Center in DeMotte at 4:30 on September 21.</p><p><b>Drainage Board meeting</b></p><p>The Drainage Board met after the Commissioners meeting. It approved a drainage plan for a company whose name I did not catch that is removing an old building and replacing it with a new building.&nbsp;</p><p>The Dunn's Bridge Solar II project is giving daily updates to the Surveyor's office.</p><p>The issue that most concerned the Surveyor was a very old 260' corrugated pipe that connects two sections of a ditch. It is near CR 430E and CR 300N and small sinkholes are starting to develop over it. To replace the pipe would require about $50,000 in materials, and it would be cheaper to convert it to a ditch, but that would require encroachment on private property. It is not clear which agency should handle this, Surveyor or Highway Department. No action was taken.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission met Monday in the late afternoon. I stayed for about an hour and then left to attend the Park Board meeting. The main issue discussed while I was there was a request from the City for financing help for sewage work. The City must construct a building for phosphorus removal from sewage and also other improvements to the sewage plant. These are mandated by the State. It has found some several hundred thousand dollars to do this, but the cost is estimated at $1,669,700. It requested the Redevelopment Commission contribute $468,200 to the project and also lend $675,000 for up to five years. Apparently the financial markets are very unfavorable for borrowing at this time. There was a long discussion about the loan, with concerns that there might be other needs for funding in the next few years. Eventually the Commission passed both.</p><p>The next item on the agenda was the funding request from JCEDO for a façade grant program. This was discussed at <a href="../../2023/08/some-videos.html" target="_blank">the previous Commission meeting</a>. I left as this discussion was beginning but I heard that the proposal was approved.</p><p>The Commission is still interested in buying and removing the R&amp;M building. A grant proposal prepared by KIRPC to do an environmental study did not get approval and the Commission wondered if it should pay for a study without a grant. There was also mention that at the next meeting the Rensselaer Parks would be asking for money to help fund the summer programming done in the Parks.</p><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The main item discussed at the Park Board was how to structure the provision of summer programming so it can continue to expand.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a new swing set at Foundation Park. On Wednesday night before the parade there was a large pile of mulch ready for the swing set.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLm8nuxJYU6kIF3w6JmeZ-cMqzWmJCJaIHUTeU1sM/s1280/Mulch8627.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="668" data-original-width="1280" height="334" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLm8nuxJYU6kIF3w6JmeZ-cMqzWmJCJaIHUTeU1sM/w640-h334/Mulch8627.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>On Thursday the installation was finished.

That night someone unwrapped the lights and stole them. Vandalism remains a problem in the parks.</p><p>There will be a ribbon cutting for the Blacker Fields on Friday, September 15 at 4:00.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Plan Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Advisory Plan Commission met Thursday evening. It held a public hearing about and then passed three zoning amendments that will now go to the City Council for final approval. Instead of having City rules for swimming pool requirements, the new ordinance will simply adopt the State requirements. Currently there is no provision for residences in business districts. The new ordinance allows them in upstairs apartments and in the back of buildings provided they have separate entrances.&nbsp;</p><p>The main discussion was about a request for a rezone from light industrial to residential for a couple of lots along Melville Street. They are in a block between Oak and Maple Streets that is zoned I1 but is entirely residential, mostly rental housing. The owner of the two lots, which are narrow lots split with a line running east-west, would like to combine them and split them with a line running north-south and then add a second house. (There is only one house now.) After a lot of discussion, the members decided it would make more sense to rezone the entire block as residential and the Planning Office will try to get a proposal to do that ready for the next meeting.</p><p>At a previous meeting the Commission had appointed Josh Davis to represent them on the County Plan Commission. The County thought that the representative should be a voting member of the Commission, not the City Planning Officer, so the Commission appointed Mike Davis.</p><p><b>Rensselaer BZA meeting</b></p><p>The BZA meeting on Thursday had two requested variances on the agenda. The first was for a carport in a driveway, which was not allowed because it is an accessory structure in the front yard. There had been no complaints and the structure is an attractive structure that had been in place for over four years. The variance was approved.</p><p>The second was for an illuminated sign that the Brookside Church (formerly the Bridge Church) wants to erect as a replacement to their current sign. After discussion, the variance was granted with the condition that it be turned off at dusk from April 1 to September 30 and two hours after dusk from October 1 to March 31.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>The exterior of the new EMS building looks finished. The building should be ready for occupancy before the end of the year.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgn8fX1QtwjzrNOdak9TzXq9mBptAPRDO3l5vzGu6k/s1280/EMS8678.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="520" data-original-width="1280" height="260" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgn8fX1QtwjzrNOdak9TzXq9mBptAPRDO3l5vzGu6k/w640-h260/EMS8678.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div>A grave knocked over? No. This is the start of a reconstruction of the marker for <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/88998620/george-w-spitler" target="_blank">George Spitler</a>, which was in danger of falling over. Spitler was featured on the first Weston Cemetery Walk.&nbsp;<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyzKmK_A2rHidAIBcbUxlnkC2RJQEv51f7ppgi6mN/s1280/SpitlerIMG_8610.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="240" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyzKmK_A2rHidAIBcbUxlnkC2RJQEv51f7ppgi6mN/s320/SpitlerIMG_8610.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div>In 1834 George and his father traveled to Indiana looking for land. In 1835 he returned to a site south of Brook where he erected a cabin. A few years later that cabin hosted the first court in the County. In 1841 George moved his family to a site just south of Rensselaer. He was the first school teacher in Rensselaer and served several terms as county clerk. George was killed by lightning in 1863. In 1867 the family sold his farm of 933 acres to the Diocese of Fort Wayne to be used as an orphanage. That land later became the campus of Saint Joseph's College.</div><div><br /></div><div>This year's Cemetery walk will take place on Saturday September 16, with the shelter program at 11:00 and the walking program at 2:00. Tickets are available at Browns Garden and Sblended.</div><div><br /></div><div>A person featured this year is perhaps the most famous person in the cemetery who people in Rensselaer have never heard of, Frank Clair. Ever hear of him? He has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Clair" target="_blank">wikipedia entry</a> and is in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Football_Hall_of_Fame" target="_blank">hall of fame</a>.&nbsp;</div><p>Another person featured is&nbsp;Ruth Bott Beam. She married the son of William Beam, who came up 17 votes short of becoming the mayor of Rensselaer in 1909. Beam has a street name for him. Do you know where it is? Ruth was the daughter of William Leroy Bott (1866-1948) who was orphaned as a child, but became a leading merchant in Star City before moving to Rensselaer in 1914 when he purchased most of the shares in the Rensselaer telephone company. On his death in 1948 he not only was the majority owner in the Rensselaer telephone company, but also that of Wheatfield and Remington. He helped found the Farmers and Merchants Bank and Camp Kanne.</p><div>If you want to learn more, come to the Walk on the 16th.</div><div><br /></div><div>The mural on the back of Markit Arts seems to be finished.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgotDBkpfkodnkEbROEPw5UY9wXD23ZnGTMRf9rLxd/s1280/preston8693.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="1215" height="640" src="../../../blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgotDBkpfkodnkEbROEPw5UY9wXD23ZnGTMRf9rLxd/w608-h640/preston8693.jpg" width="608" /></a></div><br /><p>A former Rensselaer resident, Gretchen (Schenk) Baker, has been on the news in the past few days, providing commentary for a cave rescue in Turkey. Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E56cOjOgiU" target="_blank">one example</a> (she appears at the 1:00 mark.) You can find more by searching for Gretchen Baker cave rescue Turkey. She has given a dozen interviews to the media providing background information.</p><p>Gretchen developed an interest in caving while working at Jewel Cave National Monument in South Dakota when she was in college. She now works at Great Basin National Park in Nevada. She is interviewed because she is the National Coordinator of the National Cave Rescue Commission, a group that provides training for cave rescues.</p><p>Sometime around September 1 blogger says this blog passed the 2 million mark in page views. I am not sure what gets counted in that but some of it probably is machines, not people.

<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
