<p><b>&nbsp;BPW</b></p><p>The Board of Public Works met on Monday to approve paying construction bills. First up were Thieneman pay request #19 and #20 for $239,563.40 and $49,374.11 for work on the phosphorus building, which is a new addition to the sewage plant.</p><p>(Below is a picture of the phosphorus building.

One was for $47,700 from Commonwealth Engineering to pay for their work for on-site representative, and the other two, for $360,559 and $38,000 were from Maguire Iron, payments for constructing the water tower. The tower is up and the welding done, but it still needs to be painted.&nbsp; A change order for Maguire Iron involved a deduction of $79,300 and increases of $66,000 and $110,700 that will add work on existing water towers and the water treatment plant.</p><p>A claim of $38,125 was approved from a local builder for work on the phosphorus. The building is now finished. Fire Chief Haun received approval for a wellness insurance policy that provides protection against some of the chemical hazards that firefighters may encounter. The cost of $8611 will be split between the City and Marion Township. Finally the Board approved an amendment to a grant proposal that the City is submitting for more lead-line replacement. The amendment should make the proposal score better.</p><p><b>City Council meeting</b></p><p>After the usual preliminaries, the City Council ratified the appointment of Mayor Phillips to the IMPA board. Police officer Walker was given a letter of commendation for talking down a potential suicide from the I-65 overpass.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8232;The Council passed an EDA RPR Task Order that will pay up to $110 for inspection to Commonwealth Engineering during the Brick Street Project. The money will come from the water utility, which will be reimbursed at the end of the project if there are project funds remaining. Five inquiries were sent out and two replied, with Commonwealth deemed the best candidate.</p><p>&#8232;The Council approved purchase of a shoring box (used to keep the walls of a ditch from falling in on workers) for $15,543. Two quotes were obtained and the cost will be split between the water and gas utilities. The Council approved an amendment to the salary ordinance. There was a question if this requires two votes, and the City Attorney will investigate. If it does, the second vote will be at the next meeting.. A small transfer of funds was approved as were three requests for burial rights. The Council accepted conflict of interest statements from Kevin Armold and Jeff Rayburn.</p><p>&#8232;The gas tracker for February will reflect a 6&#162; increase per hundred cubic feet.&nbsp; A proposal from Commonwealth Engineering to submit a grant on behalf of the City for additional lead-line removal was approved.</p><p>The City''s concerns about a Front-Street property were addressed in a Court hearing on January 12.&nbsp; The Court issued an order specifying what had to be done with dates. In Administrative Comments the Mayor announced that a committee had been set up to see if the old light plant could be used as a Park Department office. Ceremonial groundbreaking for the Brick Streets project will be on Tuesday, February 20 at 9:00 am. The contractor is ready to get started removing bricks and Van Rensselaer in front of City Hall will be closed starting February 26.&nbsp; The Council made appointments, apparently with a telephone vote because the second January meeting was canceled, on members of the Plan Commission, Park Board, and Redevelopment Commission.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFjhINEFCPhesPFt4tgHJWZPpSfWpcsMei5yOBg0VZFy5jNQmBIA-2IXzI6yjI807ptXArP9ot3tBwpZKLicZA-hJ96GlUs6t6m-PSS5RXcpAyeiSGdiZBPMZ1I4LQFXXHYOwsKzjWa5eLckgx0ALTjIRztIBWuMWf5vXR4F63RdxOUZ6wOJCPeh2ZvGg/s1280/RoadClosed0366.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="714" data-original-width="1280" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFjhINEFCPhesPFt4tgHJWZPpSfWpcsMei5yOBg0VZFy5jNQmBIA-2IXzI6yjI807ptXArP9ot3tBwpZKLicZA-hJ96GlUs6t6m-PSS5RXcpAyeiSGdiZBPMZ1I4LQFXXHYOwsKzjWa5eLckgx0ALTjIRztIBWuMWf5vXR4F63RdxOUZ6wOJCPeh2ZvGg/w640-h358/RoadClosed0366.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Police Chief announced that a candidate had been selected to fill the police department opening. Chrissy Martin is the new secretary in the Building Department. The foundation for the Fire Department training tower will be poured on March 2, weather permitting. The tower itself should be erected in about two weeks. The Fire Department is currently without its rescue truck; it needs repairs.</p><p>Cleanup week will be May 6-10 and the Townwide Garage sale will be May 4.</p><p><b>&#8232;Tourism Commission</b></p><p>The Jasper County Tourism Commission met Tuesday morning with two new members. The Commission agreed to be a sponsor for $5000 for the Jasper County Fair, which will be celebrating its centennial this year. Last year there were approximately 159,000 visits by 49,000 people according to a company that gets its data from the tracking on smartphones.</p><p>Ball State has completed a draft of a strategic plan and there will be another meeting in March. The Tourism Office is working with Cameron Moberg planning a marketing piece. Yodel has officially launched in Jasper County.</p><p>There were two funding requests. The first was from Main Street Remington asking for $20,000 for a large mural on the Ziolkowski building on 2 S Ohio Street. The total cost is $45,000 and the Town of Remington has pledged $10,000. The request was approved.</p><p>The other request was from the <a href="https://demotteconnection.com/" target="_blank">Connection Center</a> in DeMotte that is completing a 28,000 square-foot domed facility that will be able to host a variety of sports and recreational activities. This is phase II for the Center that already has a health and wellness building that hosted 63 distinct events in 2023. There is no date set yet when this rec center will open.</p><p>The Connection Center Rec Center is owned by the Calvary Assembly of God Church and leased to a separate organization, the Connection Center. The Rec Center cost about $2 million but would have cost double that if not for the volunteer work used in building it. The Connection Center as a 99-year lease and will pay lease payments to the Assembly of God Church until the building loan is paid and then the lease payments stop. The revenue to support the Rec Center will come from a variety of different types of membership, sports camps, rental, and tournaments. The Center is closed on Sunday, partly because it shares parking with the Church, and one of the Commission members pointed out that closing on Sunday would make attracting tournaments difficult because most tournaments like a Saturday-Sunday schedule.</p><p>Overall the Commission members liked the idea of the Rec Center. There was no dollar amount requested, but the amount that is granted may be large enough so it would require the County Council to release money from the Tourism Commission Reserve Fund.&nbsp; The discussion lasted about an hour, perhaps the longest discussion ever by the Tourism Commission. No action was taken at this meeting. The members would like more information about estimates of how much use will be by people from outside the County (tourists) and how much use will be by local residents, and that estimate may determine how much the Commission is willing to grant.</p><p>The meeting lasted an hour and a half.</p><p><b>&#8232;Airport Authority Board</b></p><p>&#8232;The Airport Authority Board met Tuesday evening. A few years ago there was a <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2021/06/miscellany-june-12-2021.html" target="_blank">proposal to put a 4-H shooting range north west of the Airport</a> and the Airport Authority opposed it. The next suggested location for this shooting range was east of the Jail and for some reason that suggestion died. The new location is on the Fairgrounds and the Board was asked if the Airport might be OK with it. The range would be designed so the shooting would be toward the west. The Board passed a motion saying that the Airport had no objection to this location.</p><p>Most of the meeting was concerned with the details of running an airport. Fuel sales for January were very low, not just locally but throughout Indiana as the weather kept planes grounded. The Airport will again offer two internships this summer, one for a college student and one for a high school student. There are some people interested in building their own hangars at the Airport and there was a long discussion of what a lease for such a building should contain, (The lease is for the land.) After many ideas were tossed around, the members came to an agreement and passed a motion to approve those terms.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>Temperatures were unseasonably warm last Thursday and Friday.

There are a lot of contested races on the Republican side. There are two candidates for US Senate, Jim Banks and John Rust. The incumbent Senator, Mike Braun, is running for governor in a field of six. Congressman Jim Baird has four challengers. Judge Potter has a challenger. Jim Walstra is not running for reelection as Jasper County Commissioners and four people would like to replace him. Jeff DeYoung has three challengers. There are five candidates for Jasper County Council at large including three incumbents and I think the top three will be on the November ballot.</p><p>The Democratic ballot has fewer contested races.

The hearing was for the abandonment of more of a tile that had been partially abandoned a few years ago. There were no public comments and the abandonment was approved.</p><p>The agenda of the Commissioners meeting had nothing of great public interest. The Commissioners approved a couple of buried cable requests, one a simple bore under a road to connect to water and the other for fiber optic cable. They approved a request from the Recorder to move from local servers to a cloud site to help avoid a cyber attack. Two thirds of Indiana counties have already made this kind of move. The voting center for the Rensselaer municipal election will be at the Fairgrounds. No mention was made of the Fire Station. Main Street Rensselaer asked permission to use a bit of the Courthouse lawn for OktoberFest and it was granted. The Sheriff's Department needs to upgrade the 911 equipment and the lowest quote they found was $335,000 and the Commissioners approved the contract pending legal review. The Commissioners also approved replacing a deputy and a corrections officer. Bids were approved for flooring and painting in Community Corrections and waterproofing the Courthouse basement.</p><p>The Highway Department contracted out some of the snow removal in subdivisions last winter and wants to continue that contracting this year and the Commissioners approved the request. They approved hiring early for a person retiring so the new person will be able to train with the soon-to-be retiree. Someone had floated the idea to one of the Commissioners of finding a barn and moving it to the Fairgrounds as an event center. The Commissioners were favorable to exploring the ideal. The Wheatfield Fire Department wants to build a new fire station near the high school and is considering including a splash pad. Project Ribeye has not seen eye-to-eye with DeMotte and is considering locating in Porter County.</p><p>The people from BP were at the meeting to discuss their plans for seismic testing in Jasper County. They have been doing testing in Benton County and seem to have run into some kind of issue. They would like to continue on into Jasper County, but the road-use agreement needs to be approved or revised. After a bid of discussion, the Commissioners decided to have a special meeting on Tuesday at 8:30 am at the Highway Department. (The conference room in the Sparling Annex had been reserved for some other meeting at that time.) BP will host another open house in Jasper County, this one at the Connection Center in DeMotte at 4:30 on September 21.</p><p><b>Drainage Board meeting</b></p><p>The Drainage Board met after the Commissioners meeting. It approved a drainage plan for a company whose name I did not catch that is removing an old building and replacing it with a new building.&nbsp;</p><p>The Dunn's Bridge Solar II project is giving daily updates to the Surveyor's office.</p><p>The issue that most concerned the Surveyor was a very old 260' corrugated pipe that connects two sections of a ditch. It is near CR 430E and CR 300N and small sinkholes are starting to develop over it. To replace the pipe would require about $50,000 in materials, and it would be cheaper to convert it to a ditch, but that would require encroachment on private property. It is not clear which agency should handle this, Surveyor or Highway Department. No action was taken.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission met Monday in the late afternoon. I stayed for about an hour and then left to attend the Park Board meeting. The main issue discussed while I was there was a request from the City for financing help for sewage work. The City must construct a building for phosphorus removal from sewage and also other improvements to the sewage plant. These are mandated by the State. It has found some several hundred thousand dollars to do this, but the cost is estimated at $1,669,700. It requested the Redevelopment Commission contribute $468,200 to the project and also lend $675,000 for up to five years. Apparently the financial markets are very unfavorable for borrowing at this time. There was a long discussion about the loan, with concerns that there might be other needs for funding in the next few years. Eventually the Commission passed both.</p><p>The next item on the agenda was the funding request from JCEDO for a façade grant program. This was discussed at <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2023/08/some-videos.html" target="_blank">the previous Commission meeting</a>. I left as this discussion was beginning but I heard that the proposal was approved.</p><p>The Commission is still interested in buying and removing the R&amp;M building. A grant proposal prepared by KIRPC to do an environmental study did not get approval and the Commission wondered if it should pay for a study without a grant. There was also mention that at the next meeting the Rensselaer Parks would be asking for money to help fund the summer programming done in the Parks.</p><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The main item discussed at the Park Board was how to structure the provision of summer programming so it can continue to expand.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a new swing set at Foundation Park.

That night someone unwrapped the lights and stole them. Vandalism remains a problem in the parks.</p><p>There will be a ribbon cutting for the Blacker Fields on Friday, September 15 at 4:00.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Plan Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Advisory Plan Commission met Thursday evening. It held a public hearing about and then passed three zoning amendments that will now go to the City Council for final approval. Instead of having City rules for swimming pool requirements, the new ordinance will simply adopt the State requirements. Currently there is no provision for residences in business districts. The new ordinance allows them in upstairs apartments and in the back of buildings provided they have separate entrances.&nbsp;</p><p>The main discussion was about a request for a rezone from light industrial to residential for a couple of lots along Melville Street. They are in a block between Oak and Maple Streets that is zoned I1 but is entirely residential, mostly rental housing. The owner of the two lots, which are narrow lots split with a line running east-west, would like to combine them and split them with a line running north-south and then add a second house. (There is only one house now.) After a lot of discussion, the members decided it would make more sense to rezone the entire block as residential and the Planning Office will try to get a proposal to do that ready for the next meeting.</p><p>At a previous meeting the Commission had appointed Josh Davis to represent them on the County Plan Commission. The County thought that the representative should be a voting member of the Commission, not the City Planning Officer, so the Commission appointed Mike Davis.</p><p><b>Rensselaer BZA meeting</b></p><p>The BZA meeting on Thursday had two requested variances on the agenda. The first was for a carport in a driveway, which was not allowed because it is an accessory structure in the front yard. There had been no complaints and the structure is an attractive structure that had been in place for over four years. The variance was approved.</p><p>The second was for an illuminated sign that the Brookside Church (formerly the Bridge Church) wants to erect as a replacement to their current sign. After discussion, the variance was granted with the condition that it be turned off at dusk from April 1 to September 30 and two hours after dusk from October 1 to March 31.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>The exterior of the new EMS building looks finished. The building should be ready for occupancy before the end of the year.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgn8fX1QtwjzrNOdak9TzXq9mBptAPRDO3l5vzGu6kXHYggyANYtS5VvcFwPvgpIr5JWHCZlQYuYI62kc4FSom97c0e5R-rhI3GdqHhb0kVsmU_tVBG2Pea-ozJZcTrDqIa3CDgBerWBSkK8XYQuXZ3eHh23_TKaVuC-WkK4392IPdxKm5IWmCk8pdfQCU/s1280/EMS8678.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="520" data-original-width="1280" height="260" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgn8fX1QtwjzrNOdak9TzXq9mBptAPRDO3l5vzGu6kXHYggyANYtS5VvcFwPvgpIr5JWHCZlQYuYI62kc4FSom97c0e5R-rhI3GdqHhb0kVsmU_tVBG2Pea-ozJZcTrDqIa3CDgBerWBSkK8XYQuXZ3eHh23_TKaVuC-WkK4392IPdxKm5IWmCk8pdfQCU/w640-h260/EMS8678.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div>A grave knocked over?

In 1835 he returned to a site south of Brook where he erected a cabin. A few years later that cabin hosted the first court in the County. In 1841 George moved his family to a site just south of Rensselaer. He was the first school teacher in Rensselaer and served several terms as county clerk. George was killed by lightning in 1863. In 1867 the family sold his farm of 933 acres to the Diocese of Fort Wayne to be used as an orphanage. That land later became the campus of Saint Joseph's College.</div><div><br /></div><div>This year's Cemetery walk will take place on Saturday September 16, with the shelter program at 11:00 and the walking program at 2:00. Tickets are available at Browns Garden and Sblended.</div><div><br /></div><div>A person featured this year is perhaps the most famous person in the cemetery who people in Rensselaer have never heard of, Frank Clair. Ever hear of him? He has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Clair" target="_blank">wikipedia entry</a> and is in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Football_Hall_of_Fame" target="_blank">hall of fame</a>.&nbsp;</div><p>Another person featured is&nbsp;Ruth Bott Beam. She married the son of William Beam, who came up 17 votes short of becoming the mayor of Rensselaer in 1909. Beam has a street name for him. Do you know where it is? Ruth was the daughter of William Leroy Bott (1866-1948) who was orphaned as a child, but became a leading merchant in Star City before moving to Rensselaer in 1914 when he purchased most of the shares in the Rensselaer telephone company. On his death in 1948 he not only was the majority owner in the Rensselaer telephone company, but also that of Wheatfield and Remington. He helped found the Farmers and Merchants Bank and Camp Kanne.</p><div>If you want to learn more, come to the Walk on the 16th.</div><div><br /></div><div>The mural on the back of Markit Arts seems to be finished.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgotDBkpfkodnkEbROEPw5UY9wXD23ZnGTMRf9rLxdOI8CMEKFy8J2DjTifh54MrtqkTR2xFUCnDA59Xy0HD-PARFrhMF5tBbih3plkHVfdccTo4EkQtOdGlt-d4SuTETJCioOpBanXlGvHpX-xgfkBP_bTuNqiHIw7701WKUSbCwYELWIwOcG5S3KLrMA/s1280/preston8693.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1280" data-original-width="1215" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgotDBkpfkodnkEbROEPw5UY9wXD23ZnGTMRf9rLxdOI8CMEKFy8J2DjTifh54MrtqkTR2xFUCnDA59Xy0HD-PARFrhMF5tBbih3plkHVfdccTo4EkQtOdGlt-d4SuTETJCioOpBanXlGvHpX-xgfkBP_bTuNqiHIw7701WKUSbCwYELWIwOcG5S3KLrMA/w608-h640/preston8693.jpg" width="608" /></a></div><br /><p>A former Rensselaer resident, Gretchen (Schenk) Baker, has been on the news in the past few days, providing commentary for a cave rescue in Turkey.

I received this comment:</p><p></p><blockquote>The basketball painting by Lillian Fendig was commissioned by the RHS Class of 1960 in memory of 1st Lt James E Taylor. Jim was a member of the class of 1960 and the basketball team wearing #23. Jim was killed in Viet Nam on February 1, 1969 and posthumously received the Bronze Star and Distinguished Service Cross for his bravery in battle. The painting has hung in the hallway outside the RCHS gymnasium. The Class of 1960 continue to honor Jim for his brave service to his country.</blockquote><p></p><p>James Taylor is <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/62891460/james-edward-taylor" target="_blank">buried in the Remington Cemetery</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>On Friday Markit Arts had a premier showing of a short film about the Rensselaer murals.

The Council affirmed a telephone poll allowing use of public relations funds to be used for expenses for Kids Night at the Farmers' Market and also approved reimbursing an employee for some other expenses for the same event. The Council also approved spending $2000 from public relations funds for a City employee Christmas Party later this year and a donation of $500 to the American Legion for their annual Thanksgiving dinner that is available to all.</p><p>The City will contribute the same amount to employees HSA as it did last year, $1800 per employee. The Council approved hiring a replacement for the Mayor's administrative assistant, who recently resigned. The City earned $50,556.25 from its recent auction and those monies were distributed to the departments that submitted items. The Council approved spending $5400 for a second Kawasaki mule for the Cemetery. The Police Department has received complaints about the new guardrails on SR 114 east of town where a culvert was recently replaced. It tells complainers that they should complain to the Indiana Department of Transportation. The Fire Department was recently one of several awarded money to expand its training facility. The Fire Chief was not at the meeting so details were sparse.</p></div>

The case was a strange one. The owners had restored an old barn, converting it into what is called a barndominium, with living quarters on the second floor. However, they did not get a building permit for this even though they had checked with the Planning Office about what steps they needed to take before they began. The fact that they had made the changes and the people were living in the barndominium was discovered by accident as something else was being checked. The Planning Office threatened enforcement and the owners then hired a surveyor to retroactively correct things. He and the Planning Office decided they should go back to the start and the first thing that they should have done was to apply for the variances. After discussion, the variances were granted, with one member of the Board voting "No."</p><p>The second step was to apply for a two-lot subdivision from the Jasper County Advisory Plan Commission, which met immediately after the BZA meeting. Here there was even more hostility because the applicants seemed to have intentionally ignored the permitting process. The Commission decided to table the application to the next meeting, assess a $2500 fine for violations, and have the owners hire an approved building inspector to see if the barndominium is up to code. The next meeting will be on September 18.</p><p>The Plan Commission is short one member and has another member who has missed three consecutive meetings, which the bylaws say is the same as a resignation. They are concerned about getting enough present to have a quorum.</p></div>

<p><b>&nbsp;Continued Commissions meeting</b></p><p>The Commissioners ended their August 7th meeting by continuing it until the 14th. The reason for continuing the meeting was to have a public hearing on an ordinance for the Health Department. The public hearing could not be held on the 7th because it had not been advertised enough days in advance.</p><p>The State of Indiana is trying to standardized rules for septic systems and has issued what it wants those standards to be. It voided all County ordinances that were more restrictive than those standards and told the counties to pass new ordinances that will be reviewed by a State technical review board in October, starting with those that are submitted earliest. At this meeting the Commissioners passed a new ordinance that remains more restrictive than the State standards in three ways. The County wants 100 feet of separation between a water well and the discharge field of the septic system, the County wants all installers to be licensed by Jasper County and the State wants installers to be licensed in at least one county, and the County prohibits homeowner installation unless the homeowner is licensed while the State allows homeowner installation. The Commissioners passed the ordinance.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Board of Public Works meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer BPW met on Monday afternoon and approved a series of pay requests:</p><p></p><blockquote><p>McGuire Iron for $593.735 for work on a new water tower;</p><p>Grimmer Construction for $157,806 for service line replacement on Weston Street;</p><p>Commonwealth Engineering for $32,388 for easement work and inspecting water tower and line replacement work;</p><p>Thieneman Construction for #36,449.84 for odds and ends while finishing up work on the lift station;</p><p>Commonwealth for $3,399.99 for supervising the work of Thieneman.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>The Board also approved change order #7 for $782 thousand for Thieneman to work on phosphorus removal at the WasteWater Treatment Plant. IDEM and the Federal Government are mandating the City remove phosphorus, and Commonwealth was approved for $116,800 for their work on this project.</p><p>The concrete base for the water tower has been finished but nothing is rising above ground yet.</p><p><b>City Council meeting</b></p><p>In the citizens' comments at the beginning of the meeting, Main Street Rensselaer asked and received approval for use of Van Rensselaer Street in front of City Hall for its Oktoberfest event in September. The Street will not be torn up by then.</p><p>The Council held a public hearing (at which no one spoke) and then approved continuing tax abatements for Conagra, Filtration Parts, Indiana Facemasks and American Melt Blown Filtration, Gold Bond Building Products (National Gypsum), and Genova.</p><p>The gas tracker for August will reflect a 2&#162; increase per hundred cubic feet.</p><p>Two bids were opened for the brick street project. One had a base bid of $2,530,554,65 with two additions of $101,114 and 51,958.20. I believe this bid was from Milestone. The other bid was from Grimmer Construction and had a base bid of $2,246,572 with the two additions of $98,684 and $66,164. The bids were taken under advisement and the winner will probably be declared at the next Council meeting.</p><p>The Council agreed to a 3% increase in employee salaries for next year's budget, and the same increase for elected officials. The Council approved using $189,300 of ARP funds to help finance the construction of a building at the wastewater treatment plant to remove phosphorus. The total cost is estimated at $1,669,700 and several other sources of funds will be used to pay for the building. This is mandated by both State and Federal governments.</p><p>A concern was raised about maintaining City Parks. A splash pad is under consideration and it may replace the baby pool at the LaRue Pool. The Street Department requested and was granted permission to replace a striper (machine paints markings on roads) for $6,408.21. The Department can no longer get parts for its current machine. The Gas Department requested and was given permission to purchase a new pipe trailer for $18,223,42.</p><p>The City auction will be held on Friday at the Police Department.</p><p><b>County Council meeting</b></p><p>The County Council began its budget hearings on Tuesday evening. Each department explains the changes they want to make in their budget. The discussion of the Coroner's and the Sheriff's budget took some time, while the discussion of the Auditor's, Council's, and EMA's budgets was quite short. The budget hearing continues all day on Wednesday, starting with the Highway budget.</p><p>Before the budget hearings began, the Council held its regular meeting. It approved an additional appropriation of $25,000 for funding the GIS team's request to hire a consultant to evaluate moving to new software. The old software is losing its support. It also approved a salary ordinance for two part-time employees hired with grant funding. The Health Department had at a previous meeting said it could pay for expanding the parking lot but the State Board of Accounts said that it cannot.</p><p>Several additional appropriations were approved. One was for medical/psychiatric consultants for one of the courts. This year there have been more than the usual number of trials with defendants that may be impaired. Another was for the other court for special prosecutor expenses.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>On Sunday I visited the Remington town park and saw the mural that Cameron Moberg painted there.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsG-iQI9j_SbSlxlnlkoLYlIE4IU8aiZSpC0_4Ffe0iDiwXjgchleNaBQu9hS3sy0k-A-hr1bQJeXP1eQYWns4b-B7_uXB5TrKw8dtKIZ2DC69w0o1Sc_DG0zPHR2RL-cuGF6OZwQhNc3CwqeS-FG08HXYikb5r1vEekbEHI2aJAW_Hn4vdcuJZ5MIrBY/s1280/fishmural8523.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="558" data-original-width="1280" height="280" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsG-iQI9j_SbSlxlnlkoLYlIE4IU8aiZSpC0_4Ffe0iDiwXjgchleNaBQu9hS3sy0k-A-hr1bQJeXP1eQYWns4b-B7_uXB5TrKw8dtKIZ2DC69w0o1Sc_DG0zPHR2RL-cuGF6OZwQhNc3CwqeS-FG08HXYikb5r1vEekbEHI2aJAW_Hn4vdcuJZ5MIrBY/w640-h280/fishmural8523.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>The park has a small sledding hill which kids find fun even in the summer.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEire5oCWCK3ABQr_KsRkryPApQhcwPYcnTO0FcoUaCEremDSrf4onIYMVYYL5lM9bFwootZM_xR8G5i0S7H1TPHLwzHuQJzJ0ZVdKGfiaDor1k717GikQu7rZ3QyAH328CC4Ja3xrYpIhXjZUIZUS5nLXPdpxjKtZfCs-JREnO6Gk0V0RDGx53MF3tgsQ8/s1280/Hill8530.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="652" data-original-width="1280" height="326" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEire5oCWCK3ABQr_KsRkryPApQhcwPYcnTO0FcoUaCEremDSrf4onIYMVYYL5lM9bFwootZM_xR8G5i0S7H1TPHLwzHuQJzJ0ZVdKGfiaDor1k717GikQu7rZ3QyAH328CC4Ja3xrYpIhXjZUIZUS5nLXPdpxjKtZfCs-JREnO6Gk0V0RDGx53MF3tgsQ8/w640-h326/Hill8530.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>And of course, the splash pad is popular.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCvd8mFbQmpR7VuL6a8HAqvtlT4bbbEPTWpsA2xGJrudW_0UvDJ3ugTdhWR-3qoy6uxKCsfP7lbRshnwAKBYu6_KlmYkaBLpaiTdyjVHe0Dwwd3skb_Bse_CriF34XjpR9z2XddVDXKtZL5MZYFLYxrXVytud9Cd0GWgfVn14qtOlWlXMdhVmhuHnBu4k/s1280/splashPadIMG_8529.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCvd8mFbQmpR7VuL6a8HAqvtlT4bbbEPTWpsA2xGJrudW_0UvDJ3ugTdhWR-3qoy6uxKCsfP7lbRshnwAKBYu6_KlmYkaBLpaiTdyjVHe0Dwwd3skb_Bse_CriF34XjpR9z2XddVDXKtZL5MZYFLYxrXVytud9Cd0GWgfVn14qtOlWlXMdhVmhuHnBu4k/w640-h480/splashPadIMG_8529.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>This park shows what can be done if a a large plot of land is designed as a park rather than have a park that grows gradually.

<p><b>Chamber luncheon and tour of Solar Park II</b></p><p>On Wednesday the Rensselaer Chamber of Commerce had a luncheon at Rensselaer's solar park #2 with a presentation by officials from IMPA and a tour of the solar field. <a href="https://www.impa.com/about-impa" target="_blank">IMPA</a> is the Indiana Municipal Power Agency. It was formed in 1983 with 26 member communities and Rensselaer was one of those founding communities. It currently serves 51 cities and towns in Indiana and Ohio. Rensselaer buys all of its electricity from IMPA.</p><p>Solar Park II is west of the primary school on Matteson. It has the capacity to generate 3.8 megawatts of electricity. The panels in the smaller Solar Park I are fixed in place. Those in Solar Park II are single axis trackers; they move to follow the sun. Many other IMPA communities have solar parks; IMPA is approaching 200 megawatts of solar capacity on 1100 acres. It likes locating within city or town limits so its property taxes are paid to a member community.&nbsp; Some asked about residental solar panels and the answer was that only three people have rooftop solar panels connected to the grid.

Because it was midday and the sun was almost directly overhead, the panels were almost parallel to the ground. Some asked why they did not plant the park with plants for pollinator insects. The answer was that many people considered pollinator fields to be fields of weeds and IMPA wanted to be seen as a good neighbor.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOV_Cgq5VvVEL3KP--__OSOpKPgKfwaLQ8HOJknJXIqYwyWeJ58A0d35-hB3UobDTJUJ-8j2sQAUogTHLYcw6BvUOszT2A2T2KBD8OxBP5RtQBhVFboo4NG4HcK1dsarJgtRnfByII8BkmMKThEeN0TyQpqu7K6SngypuMKKqm6st2zQbZUJWKJaDfASo/s1280/MotorIMG_8426.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOV_Cgq5VvVEL3KP--__OSOpKPgKfwaLQ8HOJknJXIqYwyWeJ58A0d35-hB3UobDTJUJ-8j2sQAUogTHLYcw6BvUOszT2A2T2KBD8OxBP5RtQBhVFboo4NG4HcK1dsarJgtRnfByII8BkmMKThEeN0TyQpqu7K6SngypuMKKqm6st2zQbZUJWKJaDfASo/w640-h480/MotorIMG_8426.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>Since the installation of this park, solar panels have gotten more efficient. The panels in our parks can only generate electricity from one side. Now most panels have a transparent back so that if there is reflected light from snow or sand on the ground, that light can also generate electricity.<br /><p>The <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2018/10/city-news.html" target="_blank">ribbon cutting for this park</a> took place in October, 2018.</p><p>The big chimney leaves</p><p>On Wednesday I noticed a truck that parked near the power plant.

The first was a variance of use application to allow the construction of an office and shop in an A-1 zone. The property is a six-acre lot south of Rensselaer in the buffer zone and is currently being used for construction storage. The business that wants to move to and purchase this lot fabricates and installs quartz, marble, and granite countertops in DeMotte. They plan to erect a 4500 square foot shop for the fabrication. A neighbor had concerns about materials blowing into her fields, something that happens with the current use. The applicant was agreeable to installing a fence. The application was approved.</p><p>The second item was a conditional use application for a park in a B-3 (business) zone. The park is Filson Park, land that the City Council accepted from the Filson family with the condition that it remain a park for at least 15 years. The discussion seemed to focus on the plans for developing the park, which is being funded by the Filson family. When the City Council made the decision to accept the land, the argument against accepting the land was that the land would be better used for retail or commercial uses. That argument resurfaced again at this meeting. Other concerns were vandalism and maintenance costs. Several people voiced support for continuing development, arguing that the City should respect the wishes of the donors, that it would promote tourism as an extension of the RENARTWLK, and that community members wanted more and better parks. The vote was unanimous to approve the conditional use application.</p><p>Looking back on the issue, the whole thing seems rather strange. If the Board had voted against the conditional use, would that have invalidated the action of the City Council in accepting the land with the conditions that were attached to it? Would the land have reverted back to the Filsons? The applicant listed was the Park Board, but should not the applicant have been the City Council? Can the BZA, a board appointed by the City Council and Mayor, override the decisions of the City Council?</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>Signs are up at the former Walgreens store announcing that it will soon be a Dollar Tree store.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPgjV8FRIYy0vtnQYtwrFZzZSG413vvjSS_LcNYkIsNi425BqT6AIAs_0rsIWae33wg2X9-C2ZKvk6vlK_hP3AFuxazmXq6X7DZiWFDDuAsa1uhuq7FOCpTgOYPVoei54sTtO1pE1bHhMOcacm4HrLpOmHUb4v5atcc7cPyO4MjIlrtjpXk2awVHcIcl4/s1280/dollartree8510.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="808" data-original-width="1280" height="404" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiPgjV8FRIYy0vtnQYtwrFZzZSG413vvjSS_LcNYkIsNi425BqT6AIAs_0rsIWae33wg2X9-C2ZKvk6vlK_hP3AFuxazmXq6X7DZiWFDDuAsa1uhuq7FOCpTgOYPVoei54sTtO1pE1bHhMOcacm4HrLpOmHUb4v5atcc7cPyO4MjIlrtjpXk2awVHcIcl4/w640-h404/dollartree8510.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>On the way to the BZA meeting, I noticed something new in the alley behind Fenwicks.

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
