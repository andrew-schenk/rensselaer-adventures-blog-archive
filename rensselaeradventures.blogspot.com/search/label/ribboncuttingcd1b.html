They quickly approved three buried cable permits: one for broadband in the Georgetown Subdivision,&nbsp; a second for NIPSCO repairing a gas pipeline in Remington, and a third for Farm Builders for extending a water main from Remington.</p><p>Judge Potter gave them the same presentation about public defenders that he had given to the County Council in March. He noted that while the $50,000 that Jasper County pays public defenders seems like a lot, other counties are paying more and offering benefits. He mentioned Cass County, which pays $80. He also said that there is a shortage of lawyers, giving some numbers of area counties with Warren County having none. He suggested that a joint meeting of the Commissioners and Council might find a solution and Mr Bontreger suggested that a May meeting might be arranged.</p><p>A person from Pulse Technology answered questions about a new postage machine that the Extension/Surveyor would like. Currently they use either the postage machine at the jail or the Courthouse. The Commissioners approved a lease. Corrections received approval to submit its annual grant application to the Department of Corrections. They are asking for $724,003 and if they get that amount would like to hire a recovery counselor, someone who has overcome addiction to help the inmates deal with their additions. They also received approval to replace and add security cameras. The Commissions signed a contract with Phegley Construction for remodeling the Community Corrections kitchen.</p><p>The Sheriff's Department received approval to release a vehicle to EMS. The Commissioners approved the Farmers' Market use of the Court House parking lot on Saturdays from May to October and on Tuesday afternoons after 4:30 during July and August.</p><p>The Health Department had several requests. As a result of a change in State funding, they have to spend down an account and would like to use the money to purchase two vehicles. They will look for vehicles and bring the results back to the Commissioners for approval. They want to hire a new nurse to do things that they are not currently doing and the position will be paid by State funding. The Commissioners approved. They also received permission to change some hours. Because most of the State is on Eastern time, the current hours cause some problems. Finally, the Commissioners approved hiring a part-time EMS director.</p><p>The Commissioners approved the rezone from A1 to A3 for Rose Acres that the Plan Commission had recommended. They approved an updated contract for the Recorder's Office that allows the public to find documents electronically. They also approved a conflict of interest statement that allows an employee of the Sheriff's Department to sell a K-9 dog to the Department. They adjusted that start time of future Commissioner meetings from 8:15 to 8:30. The old start time seemed to have been set so County employees who arrived at work in the Courthouse had a few minutes to settle in before the Commissioners meeting began. Now that the meetings are no longer in the Court House, 8:30 seems more convenient.</p><p>A citizen had relayed concern about speed limits on the roads around DeMotte. The Highway Department is working on a proposal. The Auditor needs to replace a deputy auditor and was given the OK. Early voting at the Courthouse for the primary election will begin April 9. Andrew Boersma expressed concerns about the speed limits on the highways bordering Wheatfield. The meeting was continued until April 15 at 8:30 if needed.</p><p><b>Drainage Board meeting</b></p><p>The Drainage Board meeting that followed the Commissioners meeting was short. The request for a variance to locate a garage on a ditch easement that was considered in March and tabled was tabled again. https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2024/03/early-march-2024-meetings.html</p><p>In several recent meetings there was discussion of replacing a tile alongside a road that is failing. At this meeting they opened two bids and accepted the higher bid because the lower bid had stipulations that they believed could not be met. The bid was for $21,400 and materials will cost $38511. The materials could be purchased from the Bridge Cumulative fund but there was a question about how the labor costs could be funded. They approved the bid pending taking money from the Bridge Cumulative fund.</p><p>The Surveyor had received a petition to clean a ditch whose name I did not catch. The Board approved having him start the process that will end in a public hearing.</p><p><b>Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission meeting</b></p><p>The Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission held a short meeting on Monday afternoon. Left over from the March meeting was a request for funding from Apple Seed that had been tabled. Apparently Apple Seed provided more financial data since that meeting, but the Board decided it was not enough and wanted financial data from Right Steps, the organization that actually runs the Apple Tree center. The request was tabled again.</p><p>A woman from Baker Tilly was on Zoom to discuss the TIF Management Report that Baker Tilly had prepared. I could not read the very small print on the screen and did not have a copy of the report. The Commission acknowledged that they had received the report. It then reviewed and approved a contract with Baker Tilly for future reports.</p><p><b>Park Board meeting</b></p><p>The Park Board met later Monday evening. It heard a presentation of summer programming for 2024 and approved it. Most or all of the events from 2023 will return for 2024, though some will be revised. There will be theme days/dollar days at the pool on Fridays in July and on June 19 the pool will celebrate its 75 birthday. There was a discussion of tournaments at Blacker Fields.

<p><b>&nbsp;BPW</b></p><p>The Board of Public Works met on Monday to approve paying construction bills. First up were Thieneman pay request #19 and #20 for $239,563.40 and $49,374.11 for work on the phosphorus building, which is a new addition to the sewage plant.</p><p>(Below is a picture of the phosphorus building.

One was for $47,700 from Commonwealth Engineering to pay for their work for on-site representative, and the other two, for $360,559 and $38,000 were from Maguire Iron, payments for constructing the water tower. The tower is up and the welding done, but it still needs to be painted.&nbsp; A change order for Maguire Iron involved a deduction of $79,300 and increases of $66,000 and $110,700 that will add work on existing water towers and the water treatment plant.</p><p>A claim of $38,125 was approved from a local builder for work on the phosphorus. The building is now finished. Fire Chief Haun received approval for a wellness insurance policy that provides protection against some of the chemical hazards that firefighters may encounter. The cost of $8611 will be split between the City and Marion Township. Finally the Board approved an amendment to a grant proposal that the City is submitting for more lead-line replacement. The amendment should make the proposal score better.</p><p><b>City Council meeting</b></p><p>After the usual preliminaries, the City Council ratified the appointment of Mayor Phillips to the IMPA board. Police officer Walker was given a letter of commendation for talking down a potential suicide from the I-65 overpass.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8232;The Council passed an EDA RPR Task Order that will pay up to $110 for inspection to Commonwealth Engineering during the Brick Street Project. The money will come from the water utility, which will be reimbursed at the end of the project if there are project funds remaining. Five inquiries were sent out and two replied, with Commonwealth deemed the best candidate.</p><p>&#8232;The Council approved purchase of a shoring box (used to keep the walls of a ditch from falling in on workers) for $15,543. Two quotes were obtained and the cost will be split between the water and gas utilities. The Council approved an amendment to the salary ordinance. There was a question if this requires two votes, and the City Attorney will investigate. If it does, the second vote will be at the next meeting.. A small transfer of funds was approved as were three requests for burial rights. The Council accepted conflict of interest statements from Kevin Armold and Jeff Rayburn.</p><p>&#8232;The gas tracker for February will reflect a 6&#162; increase per hundred cubic feet.&nbsp; A proposal from Commonwealth Engineering to submit a grant on behalf of the City for additional lead-line removal was approved.</p><p>The City''s concerns about a Front-Street property were addressed in a Court hearing on January 12.&nbsp; The Court issued an order specifying what had to be done with dates. In Administrative Comments the Mayor announced that a committee had been set up to see if the old light plant could be used as a Park Department office. Ceremonial groundbreaking for the Brick Streets project will be on Tuesday, February 20 at 9:00 am. The contractor is ready to get started removing bricks and Van Rensselaer in front of City Hall will be closed starting February 26.&nbsp; The Council made appointments, apparently with a telephone vote because the second January meeting was canceled, on members of the Plan Commission, Park Board, and Redevelopment Commission.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFjhINEFCPhesPFt4tgHJWZPpSfWpcsMei5yOBg0VZFy5jNQmBIA-2IXzI6yjI807ptXArP9ot3tBwpZKLicZA-hJ96GlUs6t6m-PSS5RXcpAyeiSGdiZBPMZ1I4LQFXXHYOwsKzjWa5eLckgx0ALTjIRztIBWuMWf5vXR4F63RdxOUZ6wOJCPeh2ZvGg/s1280/RoadClosed0366.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="714" data-original-width="1280" height="358" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFjhINEFCPhesPFt4tgHJWZPpSfWpcsMei5yOBg0VZFy5jNQmBIA-2IXzI6yjI807ptXArP9ot3tBwpZKLicZA-hJ96GlUs6t6m-PSS5RXcpAyeiSGdiZBPMZ1I4LQFXXHYOwsKzjWa5eLckgx0ALTjIRztIBWuMWf5vXR4F63RdxOUZ6wOJCPeh2ZvGg/w640-h358/RoadClosed0366.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>The Police Chief announced that a candidate had been selected to fill the police department opening. Chrissy Martin is the new secretary in the Building Department. The foundation for the Fire Department training tower will be poured on March 2, weather permitting. The tower itself should be erected in about two weeks. The Fire Department is currently without its rescue truck; it needs repairs.</p><p>Cleanup week will be May 6-10 and the Townwide Garage sale will be May 4.</p><p><b>&#8232;Tourism Commission</b></p><p>The Jasper County Tourism Commission met Tuesday morning with two new members. The Commission agreed to be a sponsor for $5000 for the Jasper County Fair, which will be celebrating its centennial this year. Last year there were approximately 159,000 visits by 49,000 people according to a company that gets its data from the tracking on smartphones.</p><p>Ball State has completed a draft of a strategic plan and there will be another meeting in March. The Tourism Office is working with Cameron Moberg planning a marketing piece. Yodel has officially launched in Jasper County.</p><p>There were two funding requests. The first was from Main Street Remington asking for $20,000 for a large mural on the Ziolkowski building on 2 S Ohio Street. The total cost is $45,000 and the Town of Remington has pledged $10,000. The request was approved.</p><p>The other request was from the <a href="https://demotteconnection.com/" target="_blank">Connection Center</a> in DeMotte that is completing a 28,000 square-foot domed facility that will be able to host a variety of sports and recreational activities. This is phase II for the Center that already has a health and wellness building that hosted 63 distinct events in 2023. There is no date set yet when this rec center will open.</p><p>The Connection Center Rec Center is owned by the Calvary Assembly of God Church and leased to a separate organization, the Connection Center. The Rec Center cost about $2 million but would have cost double that if not for the volunteer work used in building it. The Connection Center as a 99-year lease and will pay lease payments to the Assembly of God Church until the building loan is paid and then the lease payments stop. The revenue to support the Rec Center will come from a variety of different types of membership, sports camps, rental, and tournaments. The Center is closed on Sunday, partly because it shares parking with the Church, and one of the Commission members pointed out that closing on Sunday would make attracting tournaments difficult because most tournaments like a Saturday-Sunday schedule.</p><p>Overall the Commission members liked the idea of the Rec Center. There was no dollar amount requested, but the amount that is granted may be large enough so it would require the County Council to release money from the Tourism Commission Reserve Fund.&nbsp; The discussion lasted about an hour, perhaps the longest discussion ever by the Tourism Commission. No action was taken at this meeting. The members would like more information about estimates of how much use will be by people from outside the County (tourists) and how much use will be by local residents, and that estimate may determine how much the Commission is willing to grant.</p><p>The meeting lasted an hour and a half.</p><p><b>&#8232;Airport Authority Board</b></p><p>&#8232;The Airport Authority Board met Tuesday evening. A few years ago there was a <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2021/06/miscellany-june-12-2021.html" target="_blank">proposal to put a 4-H shooting range north west of the Airport</a> and the Airport Authority opposed it. The next suggested location for this shooting range was east of the Jail and for some reason that suggestion died. The new location is on the Fairgrounds and the Board was asked if the Airport might be OK with it. The range would be designed so the shooting would be toward the west. The Board passed a motion saying that the Airport had no objection to this location.</p><p>Most of the meeting was concerned with the details of running an airport. Fuel sales for January were very low, not just locally but throughout Indiana as the weather kept planes grounded. The Airport will again offer two internships this summer, one for a college student and one for a high school student. There are some people interested in building their own hangars at the Airport and there was a long discussion of what a lease for such a building should contain, (The lease is for the land.) After many ideas were tossed around, the members came to an agreement and passed a motion to approve those terms.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>Temperatures were unseasonably warm last Thursday and Friday.

The incumbent Senator, Mike Braun, is running for governor in a field of six. Congressman Jim Baird has four challengers. Judge Potter has a challenger. Jim Walstra is not running for reelection as Jasper County Commissioners and four people would like to replace him. Jeff DeYoung has three challengers. There are five candidates for Jasper County Council at large including three incumbents and I think the top three will be on the November ballot.</p><p>The Democratic ballot has fewer contested races.

<p>&nbsp;The title of the <a href="https://rensselaeradventures.blogspot.com/2024/01/real-winter-is-coming.html" target="_blank">previous post</a> was "Real winter is Coming." It arrived late Saturday night when temperatures dipped below zero. They stayed below zero all of Sunday and briefly rose above zero on Monday. Tuesday was also bitterly cold. Most schools closed on Monday and Tuesday. The cold air affected much of the middle of the US, extending down into Texas.</p><p>Below is a picture from Sunday. The snow on Friday was mixed with rain and when the snow plows cleared the streets, there were big blocks left along the sides of the roads. Then the lighter snow and heavy winds that followed created a drift around some of these blocks.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjj05_dMoX7FPqN4sHN1FuEL2uTaoi-pCw7Uh-UhaMGlTuEt4DeHx99BNyTMbqoI20HL_mRvzZ5ukhaXDsrVvM34wqjr4_WcckAIw3i5LfcYoC3tcynk6V7zMMJf6nrF5otvtPy729WhKk1rEdrRNKChSACYSUiCpEkx67bNjALW5j4dGo8z1w3YZMd8Iw/s1280/snow9838.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="944" data-original-width="1280" height="472" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjj05_dMoX7FPqN4sHN1FuEL2uTaoi-pCw7Uh-UhaMGlTuEt4DeHx99BNyTMbqoI20HL_mRvzZ5ukhaXDsrVvM34wqjr4_WcckAIw3i5LfcYoC3tcynk6V7zMMJf6nrF5otvtPy729WhKk1rEdrRNKChSACYSUiCpEkx67bNjALW5j4dGo8z1w3YZMd8Iw/w640-h472/snow9838.jpg" width="640" /></a></div><p>Part of the River froze, as this picture taken from the Talbert Bridge shows.

The Council retained its officers from 2023, Steve Jordan as Chair and Gary Fritts as Vice Chair. The agenda had two pages of additional appropriations, most because of discrepancies between the budget and the salary ordinance. A few were things that had been discussed in the past but no action had been taken. The longest discussion was about Animal Control. Several Council members wanted to see data to justify the amount spent on the Department. Animal Control said that all the area rescues are full so that they cannot transfer animals as they could in the past. All of the various additional appropriations were passed.</p><p>Rensselaer Fire Chief Kenny Haun gave the Council members a packet about the fire tower that will be constructed behind the FireHouse. His goal was to raise $250,000 for site preparation and if the County gives him the $75,000 he has requested, he will have raised a bit more than $300,000. Some of the additional funds will be used to purchase storage containers, two to hold bales of hay used for live burn training and one for everything else. The City has paid for everything done so far. The anticipated completion is late March or early April and the first class has been scheduled for April 6. There was a discussion of the problems of staffing, and Haun said that calls keep increasing but getting volunteers&nbsp;remains very difficult. Because the additional appropriation had not been advertised, the Council could not give him the $75,000 he wanted but it did vote to advertise the item for the next meeting.</p><p>The Council approved an amendment to the salary ordinance and then made appointments to various boards. The retained members and the only question they had was whether the Chair of the Council could serve on the Plan Commission. They approved a contract for their attorney and had a brief discussion about pay for public defenders.

We had two applications to this first round of the Facade Improvement Grant, both applications were very competitive. Toplink ultimately had a stronger application due to the building's size and number of businesses within its footprint. After several years of vacancy, the passion and dedication Toplink's owners put forward to completely refurbishing this building is an accomplishment. This building's predominance in the downtown area means this grant money funding will go a long way to beautify this vitally important piece of the city. We look forward to future applications and are excited to see how the Facade Improvement Grant will revitalize Rensselaer.</p><p>Toplink will use the grant funds for new windows and awning on the north side of the building, new windows and doors on the west side, tuck pointing on the entire building, and signage.</p><p>This grant would not be possible without a partnership from the City of Rensselaer and the Rensselaer Redevelopment Commission.</p><p>Our next round of grants are due by Monday, February 24th. For more information on the grant itself please visit: https://www.jaspercountyin.com/grants/</p></blockquote><p></p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>Last year the Commissioners had said that they wanted to reexamine the solar ordinance. They have organized&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=711838167768586&amp;set=a.184769830475425" target="_blank">two public meetings</a>&nbsp;to discuss the solar ordinance and also battery storage and carbon sequestration. The first is at the Fase Center in DeMotte on January 25 at 6:00 pm and the second is scheduled for February 16 at 6:00 pm at the Jasper County Fairgrounds. Hopefully they will generate more than heat.</p><p>Candidates for the May primary election have until Feb 9 to file with the County Clerk. She <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100064668432683" target="_blank">released the names of early files</a> and there will be at least two contested races on the Republican ballot. Congressman James Baird will be challenged by Charles Bookwalter. Two people have filed for the position of County Auditor, Diana Boersma and Treasure Gilbert.</p><p>Dollar Tree was briefly closed on Tuesday morning because they forgot to renew a food license with the Health Department. The fee was quickly paid and the store opened.</p><p>The Tourism Commission that was rescheduled to January 17 has been canceled.</p><p>The Fendig Gallery is currently showing the first of their local school exhibits. This one is the <a href="https://www.prairieartscouncil.net/current-exhibit" target="_blank">31st Regional School Art Show: Primary School, K-2</a>. It will hang until Jan 28.

<p><b>Ribbon cutting Blacker Fields</b></p><p>On Friday, September 15 the Park Department held a ribbon cutting ceremony for the Blacker Fields. The actual cutting was posed with the sun behind people, so my pictures of the group did not turn out well. However, the cutting was accompanied with some glitter cannons and that made an interesting picture.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8FGPzLLdOTe2m56EvvNO6Z8-tgrL0Qvvc7oBT3s4IzQTg00Dc9aEXvU9E1Vf7RyQNmxH7viOzYm9vT6xQjVPPK5SHnEepIkO3Z9oX-7RljSfn-AgEh58yFqoFJssOO84ShTd04sr-GNrh0-_uHoUH0ejEKwJ2BbRcwq4ANMa1lvhb_9LoCI4Hr5SkLQ4/s1280/Confetti8937.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="755" data-original-width="1280" height="378" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8FGPzLLdOTe2m56EvvNO6Z8-tgrL0Qvvc7oBT3s4IzQTg00Dc9aEXvU9E1Vf7RyQNmxH7viOzYm9vT6xQjVPPK5SHnEepIkO3Z9oX-7RljSfn-AgEh58yFqoFJssOO84ShTd04sr-GNrh0-_uHoUH0ejEKwJ2BbRcwq4ANMa1lvhb_9LoCI4Hr5SkLQ4/w640-h378/Confetti8937.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>Before the cutting, several people spoke, including the daughter of Rex Blacker.

There were two performances. The first in the morning was held in the Hall Shelter. It appeals to those who do not want to walk or who have something else they want to do in the afternoon. I think about 40 people attended.<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-RDo-HAilMjELh9T8d7u2jTk892jkXzqj5__pmlReu3IXuE6ijymi8JMtGV7LqjmasLEV-ACykjRR_gQQx3D9hUm1iI61muAKtABzpk0b3BwNdFRZ7WkuTmEXCDzOMpf3JD_zLOqkmOuPjankztRPNlrUzBVsr3kGMJaqN13p9P1BdrVEY6N6Mx66XdY/s1280/shelterIMG_8953.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-RDo-HAilMjELh9T8d7u2jTk892jkXzqj5__pmlReu3IXuE6ijymi8JMtGV7LqjmasLEV-ACykjRR_gQQx3D9hUm1iI61muAKtABzpk0b3BwNdFRZ7WkuTmEXCDzOMpf3JD_zLOqkmOuPjankztRPNlrUzBVsr3kGMJaqN13p9P1BdrVEY6N6Mx66XdY/w640-h480/shelterIMG_8953.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>Something special this year was that attendees could grab a free book. One of the featured descendants was the wife of John Blue, who wrote several books. Not all of them sold so his daughter used the event for inventory reduction. The blue book tells the story of the Blue family as they came from the east and settled in Jasper County. Then part of that family continued west. This is a very common pattern of families that settled here.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi28tji9RUFxXF80JpLcSKn-oOs-5Ja5V_tri87MAX744ZEldvqaff6qSJ6vhsfJum7fWYyCnSiAfvQcM_MWp3AvA7Tp2nlMVlyBrWr6ertlolPc2xLV-DaYE3qlxs9Q_Q30VGf-zcM6LNEuao0crdhqLC1Euwl5bxWDXNXCvBDTuP7m88TTJZsnmtVCtg/s1280/freebooksIMG_8966.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="960" data-original-width="1280" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi28tji9RUFxXF80JpLcSKn-oOs-5Ja5V_tri87MAX744ZEldvqaff6qSJ6vhsfJum7fWYyCnSiAfvQcM_MWp3AvA7Tp2nlMVlyBrWr6ertlolPc2xLV-DaYE3qlxs9Q_Q30VGf-zcM6LNEuao0crdhqLC1Euwl5bxWDXNXCvBDTuP7m88TTJZsnmtVCtg/w640-h480/freebooksIMG_8966.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>In the afternoon performance the attendees were divided into seven groups that rotated around eight stations in the western part of the cemetery. Below is Judy Kanne portraying Margaret Mckinney Lewis, who taught in a couple of early schools. She had three sons, one born after her husband committed suicide because he was afraid that he was going insane, something that had happened to his father and sister.

<h2 class='title'>Contacting Rensselaer Adventures</h2>
<div class='widget-content'>
To contact Rensselaer Adventures, send e-mail to rensselaeradventures at yahoo.com. (I put the @ in there originally, and of the first eight messages I received, four were the Nigerian scam and three told me I won a lottery I never entered. Maybe this change is already too late.)<br /><br />If you want to comment on any specific post, (adding information or correcting a mistake I made) please use the comment area that is available on each post. That way everyone will get to see what you think, not just me.<br /><br />I would love to hear from you if you have ideas of things I can write about. Even better, if you want to contribute something, I will consider it.<br /><br />I will not check this address every day, so be patient. (And I almost never check my messages on Facebook, so it you send something there, the odds are that I will not see it for weeks or months.)<br /><br />Also, I encourage and appreciate comments that are informative or entertaining. However, I delete comments that I think are offensive or inappropriate (which includes spam--I delete a lot of spam).<br /><br />
